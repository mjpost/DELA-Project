1970726015	3			Summary: Months had passed and Carrie was still missing Sue, despite the regular phone calls.
1970726015	4			But things were changing, things always change, and rarely in the ways that you expect.
1970726015	5			Chapter 1
1970726015	6			Carrie stood awkwardly in the corner of the bar, shifting from foot to foot, letting the noise of the crowd wash over her.
1970726015	7			The smell of cigarette smoke and alcohol was so thick in the air she could almost swallow it.
1970726015	8			“You sure I can’t get you a drink?” a bearded man shouted at her, his words slurring, the scent of hops getting even stronger.
1970726015	9			She averted her eyes and shook her head.
1970726015	10			“No thanks,” she murmured, but she doubted he could hear her over the background babble.
1970726015	11			She jumped a little as he reached forwards and hugged her tightly.
1970726015	12			“Thank you for finding Ben,” he said into her ear.
1970726015	13			“If there’s anything — anything — I can ever do for you, you just let me know.”
1970726015	14			It was… She hugged him back stiffly, grateful despite herself when he stepped away.
1970726015	15			This was what she’d wanted, way back when, wasn’t it?

1970726015	16	gender	appreciated=feminine	Wanting to be known, to be appreciated.
1970726015	17			It was just that it could all get a bit overwhelming after a while, especially with so many people focussing on her, coming up and talking to her, wanting something from her that she couldn’t help feeling that she might not be up to.
1970726015	18			It was easier when Chris was at her side.

1970726015	28			A blast of fresh, clean air greeted her and she stood there for a moment, looking at the lights of the town, at the darkness of the night sky dotted with stars above it, the noise of the celebration muted behind her.
1970726015	29	gender	they=feminine	She waited for a few minutes longer, but nothing happened, no one followed her, so she made her way back to the motel they were staying at.

1970726015	30			Though it didn’t seem unlikely she’d be spending the night there alone.
1970726015	31			Not that it mattered.
1970726015	32			It wasn’t as if she wanted Chris all to herself.
1970726015	33			But a little part of her, maybe.
1970726015	34			At least she’d be the one Chris would leave with in the morning.
1970726015	35			She couldn’t help wondering what Momma would think of her now.
1970726015	36			Whether what good she’d managed to do would go some way to counteract all the sins she’d perpetrated.
1970726015	37			All the sins that she’d committed in her heart, which Momma would have said were just as grave as the ones she’d actually birthed into the world.
1970726015	38			She… more and more, she just didn’t know what to believe, just hoped whatever was looking down on her could find some measure of grace in its heart for her.
1970726015	39			She crouched beside the bed, laid her crosses carefully on the sheets.

1970726015	61	gender	Chris'	And it really wasn’t Chris’ fault that Carrie was feeling… prickly tonight.
1970726015	62			Not that she was really even feeling that anymore, a warm feeling flooding her chest at the surprisingly unguarded look of care on Chris’ face.
1970726015	63			“I’m fine,” Carrie said, smiling up at her, then got to her feet.
1970726015	64	lexical	got	“Just got a little much for me.

1970726015	67			“Does it help?
1970726015	68			The praying?
1970726015	69			Do you think that your…” she waved in the air before pointing upwards.
1970726015	70			“Comes from up there?”
1970726015	71			Carrie pressed her lips together and searched Chris’ face for any hint of mockery.
1970726015	72	gender	them=feminine	The situation between them had been a lot better since the knife murders, but she couldn’t help the instinctive worry.
1970726015	73			But there seemed to be nothing there but honest curiosity.
1970726015	74			Carrie couldn’t help letting her eyes drift down a degree to focus on Chris’ lips.
1970726015	75			Her lipstick was barely smudged.
1970726015	76			Not that it meant anything, of course, but Carrie couldn’t help feeling a bit better anyway.
1970726015	77			Not that there was a reason for her to feel that way either, and even acknowledging that much made guilt twist in her stomach.
1970726015	78			Chris was Sue’s and whoever else she chose, but not Carrie’s, not in any way.
1970726015	79			And Carrie was Sue’s in any case.
1970726015	80			She had no right to feel anything about what Chris did, and she couldn’t let herself think otherwise.
1970726015	81	lexical	she	Realising that she’d just sat there staring for far too long, she flushed, doubtless ugly and blotchy, and did her best to remember what Chris had asked her.

1970726015	82			“Talking to Him, confessing my sins, does make me feel better.
1970726015	83			And if He did create everything, then he also must have created me, and there has to be a reason for my powers.
1970726015	84			It… it helps me carry on, despite, y’know, things.”
1970726015	85	gender	them=feminine	Things like how they had to continually keep on the move, keeping one eye over their shoulder just in case the government caught up with them again.
1970726015	85	gender	they=feminine	Things like how they had to continually keep on the move, keeping one eye over their shoulder just in case the government caught up with them again.
1970726015	86			Chris scuffed the floor with one foot, looking down.
1970726015	87			“Would you mind if I joined you just this once?
1970726015	88			Just to try things out?”
1970726015	89			Carrie stared at her, but Chris didn’t seem to be mocking her.
1970726015	90			“Sure,” she said, taking her things out again and scuttling over to make room.
1970726015	91			As Chris knelt down next to her, she couldn’t help being acutely aware that this was what Sue had used to do with her, back before she left.
1970726015	92			Back in the days when it sometimes felt like stifled anger and jealousy might rise up and crush her sometimes.
1970726015	93			Back when Chris’ presence on their eternal road trip seemed like the bane of her life.
1970726015	94			It didn’t feel like that any more.
1970726015	95	lexical	laced	She knelt in front of her bed and laced her fingers together, lowering her head.
1970726015	95	ambiguity	her	She knelt in front of her bed and laced her fingers together, lowering her head.
1970726015	96			Out of the corner of her eyes, she saw Chris follow suit.
1970726015	97			Silently, she prayed that Chris find whatever peace she sought, asking the Lord to reach out to her and, well.
1970726015	98			She was sure that the Bible — or at least her mother — would have had things to say about the way that Chris lived her life, but she wasn’t hurting anyone these days and honestly tried her best to help people, and wasn’t that more important anyway?
1970726015	99			It seemed like it should be.
1970726015	100			She opened her eyes a few minutes later and looked at Chris, which seemed the signal Chris had been looking for to do the same.
1970726015	101	reference	it=praying	“Did it help?” Carrie asked.
1970726015	102			“I don’t know.
1970726015	103			Maybe?”
1970726015	104			She hesitated for a moment.

1970726015	105	ambiguity	bruise	“Not sure it’s my kind of thing in general, but I don’t think it hurt.
1970726015	106			This time at least.”
1970726015	107			She rolled easily to her feet and offered Carrie a hand.
1970726015	108	gender	thank	“Thanks, I guess.”
1970726015	109			Carrie took her hand and pulled herself up, a strange humming energy under her skin as she did so.
1970726015	110			This had been something she’d only shared with Sue before, and she’d never been quite certain how much Sue was humouring her the times when she’d joined her.
1970726015	111			Not that she thought Sue would lie to her, but… she’d been afraid to ask, to prod further, in case she got an answer she didn’t like.
1970726015	112			This, with Chris… well, she couldn’t pretend that it was anything other than what it was:
1970726015	113	lexical	trying	Chris trying on faith to see if it fit.
1970726015	113	ambiguity	on	Chris trying on faith to see if it fit.
1970726015	114			But she also couldn’t say it was anything other than completely honest.
1970726015	116			It really shouldn’t affect her as much as it did, but…
1970726015	117			“No problem,” Chris drawled, a half smile on her lips that seemed too real for Chris’ usual studied cynicism, her eyes dark and knowing this close.
1970726015	118			Near enough that Carrie could feel the breath wash against her face, could smell the beer on it, something that shouldn’t be enticing, but…
1970726015	119			She had the sudden impulse to tilt forwards and kiss Chris, to muss that lipstick, smear it over her face.
1970726015	120			To do the things that she’d been worried Chris would do at the bar.
1970726015	121			She couldn’t be there any longer, she shouldn’t.
1970726015	122			Jesus would be so disappointed in her.
1970726015	123	lexical	stow=ide	She ducked down again, away from Chris, gathering up her crosses and holy objects and starting to stow them away.
1970726015	123	ambiguity	vs	She ducked down again, away from Chris, gathering up her crosses and holy objects and starting to stow them away.
1970726015	124			She dawdled while packing them away until she heard Chris move away, and she wasn’t sure whether or not she was disappointed by that.
1970726015	125	ellipsis	wasn't=she	She wasn’t, she told herself fiercely.
1970726015	125	lexical	was	She wasn’t, she told herself fiercely.
1970726015	125	ambiguiy	not	She wasn’t, she told herself fiercely.
1970726015	126			She wasn’t disappointed at all.
1970726015	127			Still, sleep took a long time to arrive that night and Sue seemed further away than ever.
1970726015	128			“It still seems a little unreal having each day be so much like the last.
1970726015	129			Well, apart from my days off and I always seem to have more than enough to do then as well.”
1970726015	130			Sue’s voice crackles electronically, the hum of countless miles making it hard to pretend that she’s there with Carrie, even with eyes screwed shut and Carrie doing her best to send her imagination into overdrive.
1970726015	131			These weekly calls always made her feel a little melancholy, though she’d never mention that.
1970726015	132			Certainly not to Sue.
1970726015	133	lexical	doing	“But you’re doing better now?
1970726015	133	ambiguity	better=make	“But you’re doing better now?
1970726015	134			Sleeping the night through?”
1970726015	135			Sue sighed, though it sounded fond.
1970726015	136			Carrie hoped.
1970726015	137			“You don’t need to worry about me so much.”
1970726015	138	ellipsis	do=worry	I really do, was Carrie’s first thought.

1970726015	139			You’re half my world.
1970726015	140	gender	them=feminine	But that was a bad thought, part of why Sue had left them behind.
1970726015	141	lexical	put	Carrie had put so much on her that she’d needed to get away.
1970726015	141	ambiguity	so	Carrie had put so much on her that she’d needed to get away.
1970726015	142			It made Carrie worry if she had learned too well from Momma that way, making someone so much the centre of her world that they could suffocate from the weight of it, the way she’d sometimes felt about Momma.
1970726015	143	ellipsis	try	“I’ll try not to,” she replied lamely, worrying that she was doing something bad again.
1970726015	144			It was such a balancing act, trying to avoid the pitfalls that everyone else seemed to navigate so easily.
1970726015	145			She tried to ignore the part of her that wanted to blame Chris and Sue both for the fact that she hadn’t had the chance to learn growing up.
1970726015	146	reference	it=blame	That was all in the past, and there was no point hanging onto it, however hard it seemed to be to let go at times;
1970726015	147			however often it seemed to sneak right back into her pockets when she wasn’t looking.
1970726015	148			“I don’t mind, really,”
1970726015	149			Sue was saying.
1970726015	150			“I might have made some friends here, but none like you or Chris.”
1970726015	151			Friends.
1970726015	152			A new life, one separate from Carrie, one that seemed more and more permanent with every passing week.
1970726015	153			Of course it’d be so easy for Sue, who’d never had to struggle to be accepted.
1970726015	154			But no, it wasn’t fair to think like that.
1970726015	155			Sue deserved the best, even — especially — if that was apart from Carrie.
1970726015	156			“Do you think you’re any closer to figuring things out?” she asked anyway, because she couldn’t not.
1970726015	157			Sue sighed, a harsh crackle over the phone, then was silent for what felt like forever.
1970726015	158			“I don’t know, Carrie, I really don’t know.
1970726015	159	gender	two	I… when I was with the two of you, there just wasn’t any space to think about what I needed.
1970726015	160	gender	sulking=feminine	I’m not saying it was either of your faults, but if it wasn’t Chris sulking or snapping at you, then it was you being too quiet or yelling at her.”
1970726015	160	gender	snapping=feminine	I’m not saying it was either of your faults, but if it wasn’t Chris sulking or snapping at you, then it was you being too quiet or yelling at her.”
1970726015	160	gender	quiet=feminine	I’m not saying it was either of your faults, but if it wasn’t Chris sulking or snapping at you, then it was you being too quiet or yelling at her.”
1970726015	161			A sharp pang went through her at the thought of causing Sue pain, and she covered the bottom of the phone just in case any stray snuffles made their way out.
1970726015	162	gender	they=feminine	It wasn’t as though she could deny what they’d put Sue through, and she hardly needed to lay any more on Sue’s shoulders.
1970726015	163			“We’re better now,” she said quietly when she had control of her voice again.
1970726015	164	gender	glad=feminine	“And I’m glad to hear that, truly I am, but…”
1970726015	165			She trailed off again.
1970726015	166			“So, how is Chris, anyway?”
1970726015	167			Chris.
1970726015	168			That was another weighty thought that Carrie was trying to avoid.
1970726015	169	lexical	flush=	Ever since that night when Chris had joined her for prayer, it seemed even odds as to whether Carrie would flush when looking at her, or stumble over her words for no good reason.

1970726015	170			It wasn’t like there hadn’t been… moments before, but nothing like this.
1970726015	171			Nothing that she couldn’t ignore.
1970726015	172			She hadn’t done anything wrong, she hadn’t, but she knew, even if no one else did, that the sin of envy, of lust, had taken root in her soul.
1970726015	173	reference	it=sin	No matter how much she prayed for it to be lifted from her.
1970726015	173	lexical	of	No matter how much she prayed for it to be lifted from her.
1970726015	173	ambiguity	envy	No matter how much she prayed for it to be lifted from her.
1970726015	174			Luckily, Chris hadn’t so much as commented on her new skittishness, for which Carrie was profoundly grateful, though she didn’t know how much longer it could last.
1970726015	175			And the guilt lay heavily upon her, her constant bed companion at night.
1970726015	176			Sue deserved to know, she decided wretchedly, despite having promised herself at least a dozen times beforehand that she would keep as far away from the topic as possible, that she didn’t need to burden Sue with this… nonsense running through her head.

1970726015	181			Carrie couldn’t see her, couldn’t feel her to see how she was reacting, but her stomach lurched in the following pause, fearing the worst.

3568437995	7			Button-Bright didn't seem a bit afraid or worried because he was lost, and the shaggy man had no home, perhaps, and was as happy in one place as in another.
3568437995	8			Before long they saw ahead of them a fine big arch spanning the road, and when they came nearer they found that the arch was beautifully carved and decorated with rich colors.
3568437995	9			A row of peacocks with spread tails ran along the top of it, and all the feathers were gorgeously painted.
3568437995	10			In the center was a large fox's head, and the fox wore a shrewd and knowing expression and had large spectacles over its eyes and a small golden crown with shiny points on top of its head.
3568437995	11			While the travelers were looking with curiosity at this beautiful arch there suddenly marched out of it a company of soldiers—only the soldiers were all foxes dressed in uniforms.
3568437995	12			They wore green jackets and yellow pantaloons, and their little round caps and their high boots were a bright red color.
3568437995	13			Also, there was a big red bow tied about the middle of each long, bushy tail.
3568437995	14			Each soldier was armed with a wooden sword having an edge of sharp teeth set in a row, and the sight of these teeth at first caused Dorothy to shudder.
3568437995	15			A captain marched in front of the company of fox-soldiers, his uniform embroidered with gold braid to make it handsomer than the others.
3568437995	16			Almost before our friends realized it the soldiers had surrounded them on all sides, and the captain was calling out in a harsh voice:
3568437995	17	number	Surrender=plural	"Surrender!

3568437995	19			"What's a pris'ner?" asked Button-Bright.
3568437995	20			"A prisoner is a captive," replied the fox-captain, strutting up and down with much dignity.
3568437995	21			"What's a captive?" asked Button-Bright.
3568437995	22			"You're one," said the captain.
3568437995	23			That made the shaggy man laugh
3568437995	24			"Good afternoon, captain," he said, bowing politely to all the foxes and very low to their commander.
3568437995	25			"I trust you are in good health, and that your families are all well?"
3568437995	26			The fox-captain looked at the shaggy man, and his sharp features grew pleasant and smiling.
3568437995	27			"We're pretty well, thank you, Shaggy Man," said he; and Dorothy knew that the Love Magnet was working and that all the foxes now loved the shaggy man because of it.
3568437995	28			But Toto didn't know this, for he began barking angrily and tried to bite the captain's hairy leg where it showed between his red boots and his yellow pantaloons.
3568437995	29			"Stop, Toto!" cried the little girl, seizing the dog in her arms.
3568437995	30			"These are our friends."
3568437995	31			"Why, so we are!" remarked the captain in tones of astonishment.
3568437995	32			"I thought at first we were enemies, but it seems you are friends instead.
3568437995	33			You must come with me to see King Dox."
3568437995	34			"Who's he?" asked Button-Bright, with earnest eyes.
3568437995	35			"King Dox of Foxville; the great and wise sovereign who rules over our community."
3568437995	36			"What's sov'rin, and what's c'u'nity?" inquired Button-Bright.
3568437995	37			"Don't ask so many questions, little boy."
3568437995	38			"Why?"
3568437995	39			"Ah, why indeed?" exclaimed the captain, looking at Button-Bright admiringly.
3568437995	40			"If you don't ask questions you will learn nothing.
3568437995	41			True enough.
3568437995	42			I was wrong.
3568437995	43			You're a very clever little boy, come to think of it—very clever indeed.
3568437995	44			But now, friends, please come with me, for it is my duty to escort you at once to the royal palace."
3568437995	45			The soldiers marched back through the arch again, and with them marched the shaggy man, Dorothy, Toto, and Button-Bright.
3568437995	46			Once through the opening they found a fine, big city spread out before them, all the houses of carved marble in beautiful colors.
3568437995	47			The decorations were mostly birds and other fowl, such as peacocks, pheasants, turkeys, prairie-chickens, ducks, and geese.
3568437995	48			Over each doorway was carved a head representing the fox who lived in that house, this effect being quite pretty and unusual.
3568437995	49			As our friends marched along, some of the foxes came out on the porches and balconies to get a view of the strangers.

3568437995	52			Button-Bright stared until his eyes were big and round, and he would have stumbled and fallen more than once had not the shaggy man grasped his hand tightly.
3568437995	53			They were all interested, and Toto was so excited he wanted to bark every minute and to chase and fight every fox he caught sight of; but Dorothy held his little wiggling body fast in her arms and commanded him to be good and behave himself.
3568437995	54			So he finally quieted down, like a wise doggy, deciding there were too many foxes in Foxville to fight at one time.
3568437995	55			By-and-by they came to a big square, and in the center of the square stood the royal palace.
3568437995	56			Dorothy knew it at once because it had over its great door the carved head of a fox just like the one she had seen on the arch, and this fox was the only one who wore a golden crown.
3568437995	57			There were many fox-soldiers guarding the door, but they bowed to the captain and admitted him without question.
3568437995	58			The captain led them through many rooms, where richly dressed foxes were sitting on beautiful chairs or sipping tea, which was being passed around by fox-servants in white aprons.
3568437995	59			They came to a big doorway covered with heavy curtains of cloth of gold.
3568437995	60			Beside this doorway stood a huge drum.
3568437995	61			The fox-captain went to this drum and knocked his knees against it—first one knee and then the other—so that the drum said: "Boom-boom."
3568437995	62			"You must all do exactly what I do," ordered the captain; so the shaggy man pounded the drum with his knees, and so did Dorothy and so did Button-Bright.
3568437995	63			The boy wanted to keep on pounding it with his little fat knees, because he liked the sound of it; but the captain stopped him.
3568437995	64			Toto couldn't pound the drum with his knees and he didn't know enough to wag his tail against it, so Dorothy pounded the drum for him and that made him bark, and when the little dog barked the fox-captain scowled.
3568437995	65			The golden curtains drew back far enough to make an opening, through which marched the captain with the others.
3568437995	66			The broad, long room they entered was decorated in gold with stained-glass windows of splendid colors.
3568437995	67			In the corner of the room upon a richly carved golden throne, sat the fox-king, surrounded by a group of other foxes, all of whom wore great spectacles over their eyes, making them look solemn and important.
3568437995	68			Dorothy knew the King at once, because she had seen his head carved on the arch and over the doorway of the palace.
3568437995	69			Having met with several other kings in her travels, she knew what to do, and at once made a low bow before the throne.
3568437995	70			The shaggy man bowed, too, and Button-Bright bobbed his head and said "Hello."

3118371021	2	gender	13-year-old	A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the opening day of lobster season, officials said.
3118371021	3			The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
3118371021	4			Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the girl screaming for help and then paddled over with a group to help pull her out of the water.
3118371021	5			Hammel said at first he thought it was just excitement of catching a lobster, but then he "realized that she was yelling, 'I got bit! I got bit!'
3118371021	6			The whole clavicle was ripped open," Hammel said he noticed once he got to the girl.
3118371021	7			"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
3118371021	8			The girl was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where she is listed in critical condition.
3118371021	9			The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
3118371021	10			Lifeguard Capt. Mary Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark.

2521666866	1			Ocasio-Cortez delivers powerful speech after Republican's sexist remarks
2521666866	2	gender	congressperson	Congressperson condemned ‘violent language against women’ after Ted Yoho berated Ocasio-Cortez on the House steps on Monday
2521666866	3			Congressperson Ocasio-Cortez’s outrage over a Republican lawmaker’s verbal assault broadened into an extraordinary moment on the House floor on Thursday as she and other Democrats assailed a sexist culture of “accepting violence and violent language against women” whose adherents include Donald Trump.
2521666866	4			A day after rejecting an offer of contrition from Republican congressperson Ted Yoho for his language during this week’s Capitol steps confrontation, Ocasio-Cortez and more than a dozen colleagues cast the incident as all-too-common behavior by men, including the president and other Republicans.
2521666866	5	gender	congressperson	“This issue is not about one incident. It is cultural,” said the congressperson.
2521666866	6			She called it a culture “of accepting a violence and violent language against women, an entire structure of power that supports that”.
2521666866	7			The remarkable outpouring, with several female lawmakers saying they had routinely encountered such treatment, came in an election year in which polls show women lean decisively against Trump, who has a history of mocking women.
2521666866	8	gender	them	Trump was captured in a 2005 tape boasting about physically abusing them, and his disparagement of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has included calling her “crazy”.
2521666866	9			The lawmakers joining Ocasio-Cortez represented a wide range of the chamber’s Democrats, underscoring the party’s unity over an issue that can energize their party’s voters.
2521666866	10			No Republicans spoke.
2521666866	11			But the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, at a separate appearance defended Yoho, 65, one of his party’s most conservative members and who will retire in January.
2521666866	12			“When someone apologizes they should be forgiven,” McCarthy said.
2521666866	13			He added later: “I just think in a new world, in a new age, we now determine whether we accept when someone says I’m sorry if it’s a good enough apology.”
2521666866	14			Pelosi herself weighed in during a separate news conference.
2521666866	15			“It’s a manifestation of attitude in our society really.

649728577	26			Apple Silicon is the phrase Apple presently uses to describe its own processor production, beginning in June 2020 with Apple's announcement of the replacement of its x86 Mac processor line.
649728577	27			In its place, in Mac laptop units that are reportedly already shipping, will be a new system-on-a-chip called A12Z, code-named "Bionic," produced by Apple using 64-bit component designs licensed to it by Arm Holdings, Ltd.
649728577	28			In this case, Arm isn't the designer, but the producer of the instruction set around which Apple makes its original design.

649728577	31			Rather than run an old MacOS image in a virtual machine, the new OS will run a live x86 machine code translator that re-fashions x86 code into what Apple now calls Universal 2 binary code -- an intermediate-level code that can still be made to run on older Intel-based Macs -- in real-time.
649728577	32			That code will run in what sources outside of Apple call an "emulator," but which isn't really an emulator in that it doesn't simulate the execution of code in an actual, physical machine (there is no "Universal 2" chip).
649728577	33			The first results of independent performance benchmarks comparing an iPad Pro using the A12Z chip planned for the first Arm-based Macs, against Microsoft Surface models, looked promising.
649728577	34			Geekbench results as of the time of this writing gave the Bionic-powered tablet a multi-core processing score of 4669 (higher is better), versus 2966 for the Pentium-powered Surface Pro X, and 3033 for the Core i5-powered Surface Pro 6.
649728577	35			Apple's newly claimed ability to produce its own SoC for Mac, just as it does for iPhone and iPad, could save the company over time as much as 60 percent on production costs, according to its own estimates.
649728577	36			Of course, Apple is typically tight-lipped as to how it arrives at that estimate, and how long such savings will take to be realized.

2295828387	12			Physical prototype testing is no walk in the park either.
2295828387	13			The source of the power for field tests is, of course, the wind, which can't be controlled.
2295828387	14			Also, modern wind turbines are huge, which means facilities for full-scale testing must be supersized, too.
2295828387	15			To overcome these obstacles, other countries have developed strategies that could serve as blueprints to help the U.S.
2295828387	16			Spain, for example, is a global leader in installed capacity and wind-turbine manufacturing.
2295828387	17			The Spanish Centre for Renewable Energy (Cener) is currently building an innovative test center dedicated to developing wind energy.
2295828387	18			The publicly funded facility will have testing laboratories and an experimental wind farm.
2295828387	19			A blade-testing facility will house two rigs to conduct extreme and fatigue-load tests as well as physical-properties testing.

2295828387	21			One rig, able to withstand bending moments up to 100.000 kNm, could test blades as long as 90 m, after a portion of the blade is removed.
2295828387	22			The Spanish lab will develop processes and materials to reduce costs or improve performance, mainly in the area of composites.
2295828387	23			An experimental manufacturing workshop will test new processes, and a materialcharacterization laboratory will study physical, chemical, and mechanical properties.

2295828387	34			With all this technology, the Spanish wind-turbine laboratory will be one of the largest exclusively dedicated facilities anywhere.
2295828387	35			EVOLUTION OF THE TURBINE
2295828387	36			For two decades, turbine manufacturers have examined various ways of turning wind energy into power.
2295828387	37			The design that has proved most efficient and reliable is the three-bladed model.
2295828387	38			Recent models generate several megawatts versus a few hundred kilowatts for early versions.
2295828387	39			And wind turbines are taller, to access stronger, more stable winds.
2295828387	40			The standardized shape of wind turbines is evidence of the industry's relative maturity.
2295828387	41			Now, manufacturers set themselves apart by incremental developments such as reducing weight and boosting efficiency.
2295828387	42	terminology	pitch	For example, Gamesa Eolica, a Spanish turbine builder, focuses on pitch technology.

2295828387	46			Wind turbines are reaching ever higher.
2295828387	47			Wind quality improves with height, especially inland where obstacles on the ground produce turbulence.
2295828387	48			But it costs more to put up taller towers, and hub height is limited by law.
2295828387	49			Typical height limits are between 80 and 100 m in the U.S., but some German installations are reaching hub heights of more than 100 m.
2295828387	50			Towers of 80 m have a rotor sweep of 35 to 125 m; 100-m towers have a rotor sweep of 55 to 145 m.
2295828387	51			Experts say 100-m towers are better for inland locations while 80-m towers work better on the coast.
2295828387	52			According to the Global Wind Energy Council, global windpower capacity has been rising by at least 20% annually since 2000.
2295828387	53			Modern wind turbines produce 200x more power than equivalent turbines of two decades ago.
2295828387	54			Today, there are more than 50,000 MW of installed wind-power capacity around the world, up from only 17,000 MW a decade ago.

393001955	39			The center of a wide-angle photo tends to look natural.

708025153	19			Turkey has been criticised for withdrawing from the Istanbul Convention on halting violence against women but, as von der Leyen recalled, several EU members have still not ratified the treaty at all.
708025153	20			“And others are thinking about quitting.

1527554690	1			How costumes in period dramas shape our perception of royalty
1527554690	2			Our version of the present-day royals is carefully constructed and curated.
1527554690	3			Kept at bay behind a red velvet rope, we will never get a glimpse into the bedrooms and offices of regal power.
1527554690	4			That is, other than in period dramas.
1527554690	5			In film and TV dramatisations of familiar royal tales, the audience is presented with a romanticised and glamorised vision of royal history.
1527554690	6			Sumptuous silks and gilded homes make up the lush material world on screen.
1527554690	7			In reality, they are far removed from the bed bugs, tedious political documents and the stench of recently used chamber pots.
1527554690	8			The visuals are so rich that audiences will often remember the wonderful costumes, forgetting the the bloody details of the Wars of the Roses or the shady political machinations of royal court.
1527554690	9			From the high ruffs and jewelled headpieces of the Tudors to the ballgowns and tiaras of modern royals on screen, these costume provide a glossy veneer to people and history that is, at times, quite dark.
1527554690	10			These individuals become characters in costumes.
1527554690	11			They become nothing more than well dressed princes and princesses, kings and queens in stories that often overtake reality.
1527554690	12			Royal stereotypes
1527554690	13			Costuming choices can reinforce well-worn and familiar royal stereotypes.
1527554690	14			If you imagine Queen Victoria in mourning, you might envision Judy Dench in black silk and a widow’s cap.
1527554690	15			Thinking about Elizabeth I might make you picture a regal Helen Mirren in a ruff protruding from her neck.
1527554690	16			And party-loving Charles II brings to mind the lustrous curly locks of Rufus Sewell in a long wig.
1527554690	17			Costumes can also radically challenge and rewrite how we view past royals.
1527554690	18			Portraits by Hans Holbein of Henry VIII in his later years and early screen depictions have are of a corpulent king and bejewelled monarch.
1527554690	19			Joan Bergin’s costuming of Jonathan Rhys Meyers’s Henry VIII in The Tudors (2007-2010) instead included lots of leather, tight doublets, and open shirts.

1527554690	21			Dressing up like Diana
1527554690	22			The Crown is the latest screen delight to offer us a glimpse behind the royal curtain and fans can’t seem to get enough of Princess Diana, portrayed by Emma Corrin.
1527554690	23			Unlike Henry VIII, Diana was in no need of an image update.
1527554690	24			The princess was a fashion symbol in her lifetime, and The Crown’s season four costume designer, Amy Roberts, took the opportunity to recreate some of Diana’s genuine iconic outfits.
1527554690	25			Roberts’ recreation of Diana’s early wardrobe was remarkably faithful, treading a fine line between historical fact and fantasy.
1527554690	26			Such was the furore over the fashion that brands have seized upon the outfits, creating wearable versions for a new generation of Diana fans who are eager to emulate the late princess.

1527554690	28			While Diana’s 1980s chic (now considered period costume) has enjoyed a revival in mainstream fashion, it resonates with a desire to cosplay as a royal.

1527554690	29	ambiguity	=	Costumed characters
1527554690	30			Even in historical documentaries about the monarchs, which are framed as authentic and factual accounts of Britain’s royal past, historians like Lucy Worsley are renowned for using dressing up as a way to breathe life into long-dead monarchs.
1527554690	31			While Worsley’s “dress-up box” version of history may not be for everyone, it plays into a desire to humanise historical characters.
1527554690	32	lexical	interpreters	Like the living history interpreters that (before COVID) inhabited the Historic Royal Palaces sites that Worsley oversees, donning a doublet and hose resuscitates royals who we can otherwise only view in oil paintings.

1527554690	33			Costume may help us time travel, but by lacing up a corset, tying on a ruff, or even donning a Sloane ranger Barbour jacket, a modern-day human being cosplays as royal, rendering that person a caricature.
1527554690	34			The costume creates a distance between the real person with all their problematic behaviour and turns them into beautifully dressed symbol of a bygone Britishness.
1527554690	35			There is certainly magic in the costumes but that magic can obscure the darker parts of royal history, which should be remembered.

1692271236	2			By Kaleena Fraga
1692271236	3			Published May 19, 2021
1692271236	4			The shrunken head was donated to a Georgia university after an Air Force officer brought it home from Ecuador in the 1940s.
1692271236	5			Almost 100 years ago in the Ecuadorian Amazon, a warrior died at the hands of an enemy.
1692271236	6			After being traded to an American, the shrunken head was brought to Mercer University in Macon, Georgia.
1692271236	7			His head was cut off, boiled, and shrunk into a war trophy.

1692271236	8	gender	=	There, it was put on display, used as a film prop, and eventually locked into storage.
1692271236	9			But after a careful authentication process, the shrunken head — called a tsantsa — was finally sent home in 2019.
1692271236	10			An article published in May in Heritage Science has documented that process for the first time.
1692271236	11			“This is not an oddity — this is somebody’s body, this is somebody’s culture, and it’s not ours,” said Mercer University chemist Mary Kiefer, one of the article’s co-authors.
1692271236	12			“So from our perspective, repatriation was essential, and we were very lucky that our university supported this endeavor.”
1692271236	13			After years in storage, the head was first rediscovered by Keifer’s co-author, a Mercer biologist named Joan Byron.
1692271236	14			Byron, overseeing the transfer of various taxidermy specimens to a new science building, realized that the Ecuadorian shrunken head needed a second look.
1692271236	15			Byron and her colleagues didn’t know much about the head, but started piecing its story together.

1692271236	23			Tsantsas were created from the severed heads of vanquished foes.
1692271236	24			Victors removed the skull, brain, and facial muscles before sewing the eyes and lips shut.
1692271236	25			They then molded the skin as it dried and shrunk.
1692271236	26			These war trophies were meant to trap the spirit of the enemy and give power to his killer.
1692271236	27			“Anyway, they had two shrunken human heads,” Harrison, who later became a biology professor at Mercer University, wrote in his memoirs.
1692271236	28			“I badly wanted one of those heads and by motions and gestures got the idea across.”

1692271236	34			As a result, people in the Amazon produced shrunken heads without any ceremonial value.

1591309642	3			Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2019
1591309642	4			First off, my apologies for being late in posting this review.
1591309642	5			I received this fryer about a week or so ago but didn't know what to make with it because . . . I had NEVER used an air fryer before.
1591309642	6			Also, this particular model DOES NOT COME WITH RECIPES!
1591309642	7			Nothing, zilch, nada!
1591309642	8			You pretty much have to look for your recipes online because the Instant Vortex will not provide you with any.
1591309642	9			They will give you a very broad time and heat guide but that's it.
1591309642	10	lexical	bare	In fact, my main complaint with this air fryer is mainly on the bare-bones instructions.
1591309642	10	ambiguity	bones	In fact, my main complaint with this air fryer is mainly on the bare-bones instructions.
1591309642	11			For that reason, a lot of what you do with this air fryer is going to have to be through trial and error.
1591309642	12			There are more instructions to prevent you from lighting your house on fire than there are in the operation of the machine.
1591309642	13			So, as someone who has never used an air fryer before, especially an Instant Vortex Plus 6 Quart 6-in-1 thingamajig, what did I think of it?

1591309642	15	gender	=	But before we get to why it's awesome, I need to tell you what you're going to get when you purchase this device.
1591309642	16			THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE PURCHASING:
1591309642	17			1.) Most timers (at least in the US) when they are 00:00 it means 00 mins : 00 seconds.
1591309642	18			Not so with this air fryer.
1591309642	19			With the Instant Vortex the first two digits are hours and the last two digits are minutes.
1591309642	20			This was not clear in the instruction manual.
1591309642	21			Remember, I've never used an air fryer before, so this was new to me.
1591309642	22			2.) When using air fryer mode, at around 3 quarters time, the fryer will ask you to turn over your food.
1591309642	23			This was also not very clear in the instructions.
1591309642	24			3.) The basket is SMALL and not ideal for party size servings.
1591309642	25	lexical	run	Six quarts is good for a couple, but anyone with a big family is going to find themselves running multiple batches to get enough food cooked.
1591309642	25	ambiguity	=	Six quarts is good for a couple, but anyone with a big family is going to find themselves running multiple batches to get enough food cooked.
1591309642	26	lexical	super	If you're planning a big super bowl wing fest, you might want to get something bigger.
1591309642	26	ambiguity	bowl=	If you're planning a big super bowl wing fest, you might want to get something bigger.
1591309642	27			BONUS: The air fryer DOES NOT get dangerously hot like an oven.
1591309642	28			You can accidentally touch the top of the fryer and not burn your hand off.
1591309642	29			The vent in the back is also warm but not blazing hot.
1591309642	30			As long as the safety instructions are followed, this machine feels very safe to use.
1591309642	31			Somehow we didn't blow a fuse when using the microwave and the air fryer at the same time, so that was also impressive, but your results may vary.
1591309642	32			All right, so let's get into exactly how I used my air fryer as someone who has never, ever used one before.
1591309642	33			- We added pepper and salt to the raw wings.
1591309642	34			Then we greased the tray and basket with Pam cooking oil.
1591309642	35			EDIT: (Don't grease the tray with PAM.
1591309642	36			You can spray your food not your tray.
1591309642	37			Or use a substitute instead of PAM.)
1591309642	38			- We found an online recipe that was for 24 minutes.
1591309642	39			At the twelve minute mark we flip over the wings and cook the other side.
1591309642	40			- After putting the food into the tray and setting the fryer for 12 minutes, we quickly discovered that the fryer must PREHEAT first.
1591309642	41	reference	it	After it ran through its preheat cycle, then it said "ADD FOOD."
1591309642	41	gender	=	After it ran through its preheat cycle, then it said "ADD FOOD."
1591309642	42			Whoops.
1591309642	43			The wings stayed in there anyway.
1591309642	44			- At around 5 minutes, the fryer then said "TURN FOOD OVER."
1591309642	45	reference	it	We didn't know it was going to give us this prompt.
1591309642	45	gender	=	We didn't know it was going to give us this prompt.
1591309642	47			- Once the timer was finished, we removed the basket and saw that the wings were halfway cooked, awesome!
1591309642	48	reference	them	We popped them back in for another 12 minutes but made note that in the future, we just put them in for 24 and wait for the fryer to tell us when to flip.
1591309642	48	gender	=	We popped them back in for another 12 minutes but made note that in the future, we just put them in for 24 and wait for the fryer to tell us when to flip.
1591309642	49			Also, not once did I feel a blast of hot air like I do when taking things out of the oven.
1591309642	50			The fryer and the basket felt safe to handle AT ALL TIMES.
1591309642	51			- After another twelve minutes it was time to taste test.
1591309642	52			Did the wings cook thoroughly or were we about to get a case of salmonella?
1591309642	53			- The answer was YES!
1591309642	54			The wings cooked thoroughly.
1591309642	55			The exterior skin was nice and crunchy while the inside was juicy and flavorful.
1591309642	56			All of the excess oil dripped off of the wings and settled at the bottom of the basket.
1591309642	57			Awesome!
1591309642	58			- Clean up required dumping out the remaining oil into a bag, then cleaning the basket and grill with paper towels and water.
1591309642	59			THEN WE TRIED COOKING SALMON USING THE BAKE SETTING.
1591309642	60			- Grease the grill with pam.
1591309642	61			EDIT: DO NOT GREASE THE GRILL WITH PAM.
1591309642	62			You can put PAM on your food but not the grill tray.
1591309642	63			Supposedly this starts to erode some of the coating on the tray.
1591309642	64			Whoops!
1591309642	65			Found this out recently.
1591309642	66			- Pop 1.6lbs of Salmon into the basket.
1591309642	67			(This time we waited for the preheat)
1591309642	68			- Cooked for 7 minutes at 389 I believe.
1591309642	69			Don't remember.
1591309642	70			- Took the salmon out and found that the interior was still raw.
1591309642	71			Whoops.
1591309642	72			Again, no recipes means we don't know what the heck we're doing with this thing.
1591309642	73			Pop it back in for another 7 minutes.
1591309642	74			- Salmon bakes and is now thoroughly cooked.
1591309642	75			Still good, still flavorful, but we underestimated cooking time.
1591309642	76			WHAT ABOUT THE BROIL, ROAST, REHEAT & DEHYDRATE FEATURE?
1591309642	77			I, unfortunately, do not know.
1591309642	78			We haven't really roasted, broiled, or dehydrated food in my house.
1591309642	79	reference	it	However, if the chicken wings and salmon are the standard it sets, then I'm sure those features will work perfectly.

2608097372	4			Hey Arnold is a Nickelodeon cartoon series that originally ran for five seasons from 1996 to 2004.
2608097372	5			This DVD box set from Shout Factory contains the first 20 episodes of the series.
2608097372	6			The series was created by Craig Bartlett and depicts the life of title character Arnold and his interactions with his quirky classmates and bizarre neighbors in the large nameless city in which they all live.

2608097372	14			The old set also had some compatibility issues related to the nature of the product; being burned on demand onto DVD-R discs led to complaints about the discs not being playable on certain players.

2608097372	20			Overall, this is a quality release of the complete first season and overlooking the lack of anything but the episodes themselves fans should be happy to finally see this series come to DVD.
2608097372	21			This is the fourth Nickelodeon release from Shout Factory, following the first seasons of The Wild Thornberrys, Rocko's Modern Life, and Hey Dude.
2608097372	22			Several more are planned for the rest of the year, including The Angry Beavers Seasons 1 & 2, Danny Phantom Season 1, Aaahh!! Real Monsters Season 1, Catdog Season 1 Part 1 and The Wild Thornberrys Season 2 Part 1.
2608097372	23			So far I feel like Shout Factory is doing a great job with these sets and I hope their partnership with Nickelodeon can continue for years to come.
2608097372	24			Note: All five seasons of Hey Arnold were at one time available from Amazon.
2608097372	25			Those seasons are the older MOD releases, and seasons 2-5 have NOT been announced or released by Shout Factory.
2608097372	26			As of July 16, 2011 the older MOD releases have been discontinued, however they may still be available through third party sellers.
2608097372	27			Additional Note: Many of the reviews on this page refer to the old MOD release of season 1.
2608097372	28			The episodes on this release are the same, however the reviews of the quality of the product itself seen here do not reflect this retail release.
2608097372	29			I have written to Amazon requesting they remove the old reviews; they have not yet done so.

1216176690	23			He was grateful for what he had.
1216176690	24			He just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder.

1216176690	35			And not only to invest in your own home but to reach out and help raise kids in the broader community.

1216176690	41			He worked, helping people to find jobs and to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods.

1216176690	43			He talked about the world as it is and the world as it should be.
1216176690	44			And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign.
1216176690	45			What he said, that all too often, is that we accept the distance between those two ideas.
1216176690	46			And sometimes we settle for the world as it is, even when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations.
1216176690	47			But Barack reminded us on that day, all of us in that room, that we all know what our world should look like.

1216176690	49			We all know.
1216176690	50			And he urged the people in that meeting, in that community, to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas, to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should be, one and the same.

1216176690	58			And that's important to keep in mind.
1216176690	59			Part of that health includes an outstanding education.
1216176690	60			The difference between a struggling family and a healthy one is often the presence of an empowered woman or women at the center of that family.
1216176690	61			The difference between a broken community and a thriving one is often the healthy respect between men and women who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society.
1216176690	62			The difference between a languishing nation and one that will flourish is the recognition that we need equal access to education for both boys and girls.

4012302545	6	number	you	And I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked.
4012302545	7			So this is it.
4012302545	8			And for those of you that weren't there, the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers in circumference.
4012302545	9			Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began, up to 600 million times a second.
4012302545	10			It's nothing if not ambitious.
4012302545	11			This is the machine below Geneva.
4012302545	12			We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors.
4012302545	13			This is the one I work on.

4012302545	20			In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th we knew the machine worked, which is a great triumph.
4012302545	21			I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer, or this, when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that.
4012302545	22			It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact.
4012302545	23			About a week later we had a problem with the machine, related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires.
4012302545	24	lexical	Carry=	Those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power.

4012302545	29			In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC, there was a manufacturing defect.
4012302545	30			So the wire heated up slightly, and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance.
4012302545	31			This was the result.
4012302545	32			Now that's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons, and they moved about a foot.
4012302545	33			So we damaged about 50 of the magnets.
4012302545	34			We had to take them out, which we did.
4012302545	35			We reconditioned them all, fixed them.
4012302545	36			They're all on their way back underground now.
4012302545	37			By the end of March the LHC will be intact again.
4012302545	38			We will switch it on, and we expect to take data in June or July, and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are.
4012302545	39			Now of course, in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge.
4012302545	41			I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that we're overreaching, is the value of things like the LHC.
4012302545	42			I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphrey Davy, who, I suspect, when defending his protege's useless experiments -- his protege was Michael Faraday -- said this, "Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate, that there are no mysteries in nature, that our triumphs are complete, and that there are no new worlds to conquer."

3306536718	8			Spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us.
3306536718	9			So, as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi -- I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer, instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop, what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically, arranging it the way we wanted?
3306536718	10			This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer, by building Siftables.
3306536718	11	lexical	nutshell	In a nutshell, a Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie.
3306536718	11	ambiguity	=	In a nutshell, a Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie.

3306536718	12	ambiguity	canvas	They're able to be moved around by hand, they can sense each other, they can sense their motion, and they have a screen and a wireless radio.
3306536718	13			Most importantly, they're physical, so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping.
3306536718	14			And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information.
3306536718	15			And as these tools become more physical, more aware of their motion, aware of each other, and aware of the nuance of how we move them, we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.
3306536718	16			So, I'm going to start with some simple examples.
3306536718	17			This Siftable is configured to show video, and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way; if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards.
3306536718	19	reference	they	So if I put them next to each other, they get interested.
3306536718	20	reference	they	If they get surrounded, they notice that too, they might get a little flustered.
3306536718	21	reference	they	And they can also sense their motion and tilt.
3306536718	22			One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize, was that we could use everyday gestures on data, like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid.
3306536718	23			So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one, where they get mixed.
3306536718	24			If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back.
3306536718	25			There are also some neat possibilities for education, like language, math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly, and view the results immediately.
3306536718	26			So here I'm -- This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program.
3306536718	27			Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle.
3306536718	28	reference	it	Basically, in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable, and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary.
3306536718	29	reference	it	Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles, and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.
3306536718	30			Thank you.

3306536718	36			That's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right.
3306536718	37			Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up.
3306536718	38			So to him, they were just blocks.
3306536718	39			Now, this is an interactive cartoon application.
3306536718	40			And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners.
3306536718	41			And this is Felix, actually.
3306536718	42			And he can bring new characters into the scene, just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them.
3306536718	43			Here, he's bringing the sun out.
3306536718	44			David Merrill: Now he's brought a tractor into the scene.
3306536718	45			Good job! Yeah!
3306536718	46			DM: So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- Video: Woof!
3306536718	47			DM: inventing his own narrative.
3306536718	48			DM: It's an open-ended story, and he gets to decide how it unfolds.
3306536718	49	number	you	DM: So, the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently, in which Siftables act as sounds like lead, bass and drums.
3306536718	50			Each of these has four different variations, you get to choose which one you want to use.
3306536718	51			And you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want.
3306536718	52			And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable.
3306536718	53			There are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter.
3306536718	54			You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it.
3306536718	55			And then, overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence.
3306536718	56			So let's have a look.
3306536718	57			Video: DM: We'll start by putting a lead into two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series, extend it, add a little more lead.
3306536718	58			Now I put a bass line in.
3306536718	59			Video: DM: Now I'll put some percussion in.
3306536718	60			Video: DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live.
3306536718	61			Video: DM: I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other.
3306536718	62			Video: DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression.
3306536718	63			Video: DM: I can rearrange the sequence while it plays.

3644621060	1			Elizabeth Gilbert muses on the impossible things we expect from artists and geniuses -- and shares the radical idea that, instead of the rare person "being" a genius, all of us "have" a genius.

3644621060	4			Elizabeth Gilbert: Your elusive creative genius
3644621060	5	gender	writer	I am a writer.
3644621060	6			Writing books is my profession but it's more than that, of course.
3644621060	7	reference	writting	It is also my great lifelong love and fascination.
3644621060	8			And I don't expect that that's ever going to change.
3644621060	9			But, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career, which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work.
3644621060	10			And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book, this memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love" which, decidedly unlike any of my previous books, went out in the world for some reason, and became this big, mega-sensation, international bestseller thing.
3644621060	11	gender	doomed	The result of which is that everywhere I go now, people treat me like I'm doomed.

3644621060	20			Like that, you know.
3644621060	21			The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is, "Yes."

3644621060	25			But, when it comes to writing, the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately, and wondering about lately, is why?
3644621060	26			You know, is it rational?
3644621060	27			Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.
3644621060	28			And what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do, you know?
3644621060	29			Like my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer and I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know?
3644621060	30	lexical	block=mass	That chemical-engineering block, John, how's it going?

3644621060	31	ambiguity	up	It just didn't come up like that, you know?
3644621060	32	gender	fair=feminine	But to be fair, chemical engineers as a group haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic-depressives.
3644621060	33			We writers, we kind of do have that reputation, and not just writers, but creative people across all genres, it seems, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable.
3644621060	34			And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands, you know?
3644621060	35			And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts, you know.
3644621060	36			Norman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said, "Every one of my books has killed me a little more."
3644621060	37			An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work.
3644621060	38			But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this, because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish.

3644621060	45			And I definitely know that, in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption, particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career.
3644621060	46	gender	young	Which is -- you know, like check it out, I'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old.
3644621060	47			I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me.
3644621060	48			And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book, right?
3644621060	49			I should just put it bluntly, because we're all sort of friends here now -- it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.
3644621060	50			So Jesus, what a thought!

3644621060	52			I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love.
3644621060	53			And so, the question becomes, how?
3644621060	54	lexical	Construct	And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection, that the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing, is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right?

3644621060	55			I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on.
3644621060	56			And, as I've been looking, over the last year, for models for how to do that, I've been sort of looking across time, and I've been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity.
3644621060	57			And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.
3644621060	58	reference	it	So stay with me, because it does circle around and back.
3644621060	59			But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then, OK?
3644621060	60			People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source, for distant and unknowable reasons.
3644621060	61			The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity "daemons."
3644621060	62			Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar.
3644621060	63			The Romans had the same idea, but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius.
3644621060	64			Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual.
3644621060	65			They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity, who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio, kind of like Dobby the house elf, and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work.
3644621060	66			So brilliant -- there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about -- that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work.
3644621060	67	reference	it	And everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right?
3644621060	68			So the ancient artist was protected from certain things, like, for example, too much narcissism, right?
3644621060	69			If your work was brilliant, you couldn't take all the credit for it, everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you.
3644621060	70	lexical	if	If your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know?
3644621060	70	ambiguity	your	If your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know?
3644621060	71			Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame.
3644621060	72			And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time.
3644621060	73			And then the Renaissance came and everything changed, and we had this big idea, and the big idea was, let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries, and there's no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine.
3644621060	74			And it's the beginning of rational humanism, and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual.
3644621060	75			And for the first time in history, you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius, rather than having a genius.
3644621060	76	number	you	And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error.
3644621060	77	x	x	You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person to believe that he or she is like, the vessel, you know, like the font and the essence and the source of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche.
3644621060	78			It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun.
3644621060	79	reference	it	It just completely warps and distorts egos, and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance.
3644621060	81	reference	it	And, if this is true, and I think it is true, the question becomes, what now?
3644621060	82			Can we do this differently?
3644621060	83			Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery.
3644621060	84			Maybe not.
3644621060	85			Maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech.
3644621060	86			And there's probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of, basically, fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff.

3644621060	87	ambiguity	along	I'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this.
3644621060	88			But the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know, why not?
3644621060	89	reference	it	Why not think about it this way?
3644621060	90	reference	it	Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process.
3644621060	91			A process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here --- knows does not always behave rationally.
3644621060	92			And, in fact, can sometimes feel downright paranormal.
3644621060	93			I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone, who's now in her 90s, but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia, she would be out working in the fields, and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape.
3644621060	94	reference	it	And she said it was like a thunderous train of air.
3644621060	95	reference	it	And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape.
3644621060	96	reference	it	And she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet.
3644621060	97			She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point, and that was to, in her words, "run like hell."
3644621060	98	x	x	And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem, and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her, she could collect it and grab it on the page.
3644621060	99			And other times she wouldn't be fast enough, so she'd be running and running, and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape, looking, as she put it "for another poet."
3644621060	100	lexial	miss=	And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never forgot -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right?
3644621060	100	ambiguity	miss	And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never forgot -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right?

3644621060	101	reference	it	So, she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her, and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her, and then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it.
3644621060	102			She would catch the poem by its tail, and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page.
3644621060	103			And in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards, from the last word to the first.
3644621060	104			So when I heard that I was like -- that's uncanny, that's exactly what my creative process is like.
3644621060	105	lexical	pipeline	That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline!

3644621060	106			I'm a mule, and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day, and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly.
3644621060	107	lexical	brushed	But even I, in my mulishness, even I have brushed up against that thing, at times.
3644621060	107	ambiguity	up	But even I, in my mulishness, even I have brushed up against that thing, at times.
3644621060	108			And I would imagine that a lot of you have too.
3644621060	109			You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify.
3644621060	110			And what is that thing?
3644621060	111			And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds, but, in fact, might actually keep us sane?
3644621060	112			And for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits, who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment.
3644621060	113			And we were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for most of his life, he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist, trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized.
3644621060	114			But then he got older, he got calmer, and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles, and this is when it all changed for him.
3644621060	115			And he's speeding along, and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody, that comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elusive and tantalizing, and he wants it, it's gorgeous, and he longs for it, but he has no way to get it.
3644621060	116			He doesn't have a piece of paper, or a pencil, or a tape recorder.
3644621060	117			So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like, "I'm going to lose this thing, and I'll be be haunted by this song forever.
3644621060	118			I'm not good enough, and I can't do it."
3644621060	119			And instead of panicking, he just stopped.
3644621060	120			He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel.
3644621060	121			He just looked up at the sky, and he said, "Excuse me, can you not see that I'm driving?"
3644621060	122			Do I look like I can write down a song right now?
3644621060	123			If you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you.
3644621060	124			Otherwise, go bother somebody else today.
3644621060	125			Go bother Leonard Cohen.
3644621060	126			And his whole work process changed after that.
3644621060	127			Not the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever.
3644621060	128			But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie, the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it back where it came from, and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing.
3644621060	129			It could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration, kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing that was not quite Tom.
3644621060	130			When I heard that story, it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too, and this idea already saved me once.
3644621060	131	reference	it	It saved me when I was in the middle of writing "Eat, Pray, Love," and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster, the worst book ever written.
3644621060	132			Not just bad, but the worst book ever written.
3644621060	133			And I started to think I should just dump this project.
3644621060	134			But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it.
3644621060	135			So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room.
3644621060	136			And I said aloud, "Listen you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault, right?
3644621060	137			Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this, I don't have any more than this.
3644621060	138			If you want it to be better, you've got to show up and do your part of the deal.
3644621060	139			But if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it.
3644621060	140			I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job.

3644621060	141	ambiguity	up	And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job."
3644621060	142			Because -- Because in the end it's like this, OK -- centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa, people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours, until dawn.
3644621060	143			They were always magnificent, because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific, right?
3644621060	144			But every once in a while, very rarely, something would happen, and one of these performers would actually become transcendent.
3644621060	145			And I know you know what I'm talking about, because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life, a performance like this.
3644621060	146			It was like time would stop, and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done, 1,000 nights before, but everything would align.
3644621060	147			And all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human.
3644621060	148			He would be lit from within, and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity.
3644621060	149			And when this happened, back then, people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name.
3644621060	150			They would put their hands together and they would start to chant, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God."
3644621060	151			That's God, you know.
3644621060	152			Curious historical footnote: when the Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from "Allah, Allah, Allah," to "Olé, olé, olé," which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances.
3644621060	153			In Spain, when a performer has done something impossible and magic, "Allah, olé, olé, Allah, magnificent, bravo," incomprehensible, there it is -- a glimpse of God.
3644621060	154			Which is great, because we need that.
3644621060	155			But, the tricky bit comes the next morning, for the dancer himself, when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m., and he's no longer a glimpse of God.
3644621060	156			He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees, and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again.
3644621060	157			And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins, and what is he then to do with the rest of his life?
3644621060	158			This is hard.
3644621060	159			This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life.
3644621060	160			But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe, in the first place, that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you.
3644621060	161	reference	they	But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished, with somebody else.
3644621060	162			And, you know, if we think about it this way, it starts to change everything.
3644621060	163			This is how I've started to think, and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will soon be published, as the dangerously, frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success.

1063656973	5			Craig Venter: On the verge of creating synthetic life
1063656973	6			You know, I've talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean, and discovering new sets of genes.
1063656973	7			We're actually starting at a new point: we've been digitizing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life.
1063656973	8			So, we've always been trying to ask big questions.
1063656973	9			What is life? is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels.
1063656973	10	reference	it=	We've tried various approaches, paring it down to minimal components.
1063656973	10	gender	life	We've tried various approaches, paring it down to minimal components.
1063656973	11	reference	it	We've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years; when we sequenced the human genome, it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer.
1063656973	11	gender	=	We've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years; when we sequenced the human genome, it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer.
1063656973	12			Now we're trying to ask, "Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe?"
1063656973	13	lexical	Come	This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory, and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome.
1063656973	13	ambiguity	up=	This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory, and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome.
1063656973	14			We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here.
1063656973	15	reference	it=	When we look at its metabolic map, it's relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me, this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time, it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell.
1063656973	16			So we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions.
1063656973	17			And so we started down the road of: can we synthesize a chromosome?
1063656973	18			Can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before?
1063656973	19			And if we do, can we boot up a chromosome?
1063656973	20			A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material.
1063656973	21			So, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace.
1063656973	22			Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing, and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve.
1063656973	23			We started this over 15 years ago.
1063656973	24			It took several stages, in fact, starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments.
1063656973	25			But it turns out synthesizing DNA is very difficult.
1063656973	26			There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece, the more errors there are.
1063656973	27			So we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors.
1063656973	28			And this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information of the genome of phi X174.
1063656973	29			It's a small virus that kills bacteria.
1063656973	30			We designed the pieces, went through our error correction and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters.
1063656973	31			The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria, and the bacteria started to read this genetic code, made the viral particles.
1063656973	32			The viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli.
1063656973	33			I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model.
1063656973	34			They laughed more than you guys are.
1063656973	35			And so, we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system.
1063656973	36	Terminology	Cassestes=	But we wanted to go much larger: we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome -- it's over 580,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are.
1063656973	37			Design is critical, and if you're starting with digital information in the computer, that digital information has to be really accurate.
1063656973	38			When we first sequenced this genome in 1995, the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs.
1063656973	39			We actually found, on resequencing it, 30 errors; had we used that original sequence, it never would have been able to be booted up.
1063656973	40			Part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together.
1063656973	41			We design unique elements into this.
1063656973	42	number	you	You may have read that we put watermarks in.
1063656973	43			Think of this: we have a four-letter genetic code -- A, C, G and T.
1063656973	44	Terminology	Triplets=	Triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids, such that there's a single letter designation for each of the amino acids.
1063656973	45			So we can use the genetic code to write out words, sentences, thoughts.
1063656973	46			Initially, all we did was autograph it.
1063656973	47			Some people were disappointed there was not poetry.
1063656973	48			We designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes.
1063656973	49	reference	them=	There are enzymes that repair them and put them together.
1063656973	50	lexical	letters	And we started making pieces, starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters, put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces, then put sets of those going up to 72,000.

1063656973	52			We're trying to get to the point of automation.
1063656973	53			So, this looks like a basketball playoff.
1063656973	54			When we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pairs, they won't any longer grow readily in E. coli -- it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanisms.
1063656973	55			We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together.
1063656973	56	reference	it	Here's an example of it: there's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation.

1063656973	58	reference	radiodurans	Twelve to 24 hours later, it put it back together exactly as it was before.
1063656973	59			We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
1063656973	60			These organisms can be totally desiccated; they can live in a vacuum.
1063656973	61			I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space, move around, find a new aqueous environment.
1063656973	62			In fact, NASA has shown a lot of this is out there.
1063656973	63			Here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes, actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in; yeast puts them together automatically.
1063656973	64			This is not an electron micrograph; this is just a regular photomicrograph.
1063656973	65			It's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope.
1063656973	66			These are pictures over about a six-second period.
1063656973	67			So, this is the publication we had just a short while ago.
1063656973	68			This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code; it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure.
1063656973	69	reference	it=	It's over 300 million molecular weight.

1063656973	70	gender	=	If we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing, it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code.
1063656973	71			Well, how do we boot up a chromosome?
1063656973	72			How do we activate this?
1063656973	73			Obviously, with a virus it's pretty simple; it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria.
1063656973	74			It's also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves: you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one, and that's what you've all heard about with cloning.
1063656973	75			With bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell, but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it.
1063656973	76	number	you=plural	We purified a chromosome from one microbial species -- roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice -- we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome, we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins, and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell -- and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here.

1063656973	77			The new chromosome went into the cell.
1063656973	78			In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went, but we tried to design the process a little bit further.
1063656973	79			This is a major mechanism of evolution right here.
1063656973	80			We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere, adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species.
1063656973	81			So, people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology.
1063656973	82			There are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest DNA.
1063656973	83	reference	one=	The chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one; the chromosome we put in does.

1063656973	86	gender	=	And with a very short period of time, all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell.
1063656973	87			All the proteins changed, the membranes changed; when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in.
1063656973	88			So, this may sound like genomic alchemy, but we can, by moving the software of DNA around, change things quite dramatically.
1063656973	89			Now I've argued, this is not genesis; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution.
1063656973	90			And I've argued that we're about to perhaps create a new version of the Cambrian explosion, where there's massive new speciation based on this digital design.
1063656973	91			Why do this?
1063656973	92			I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs.
1063656973	93			We're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years.
1063656973	94			To put it in context for myself: I was born in 1946.
1063656973	95			There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 1946; within 40 years, there'll be four.
1063656973	96			We have trouble feeding, providing fresh, clean water, medicines, fuel for the six and a half billion.

1063656973	97	ambiguity	=	It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine.
1063656973	98			We use over five billion tons of coal, 30 billion-plus barrels of oil -- that's a hundred million barrels a day.
1063656973	99			When we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that, it's going to be a huge challenge.
1063656973	100			Then of course, there's all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere.
1063656973	101			We now, from our discovery around the world, have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think of these as the design components of the future.
1063656973	102			The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components, and look at the diversity that came out of that.
1063656973	103			We're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination.
1063656973	104			We now have techniques, because of these rapid methods of synthesis, to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics.
1063656973	105			We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day.
1063656973	106			When you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals, new vaccines, we can just with a small team, do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science.
1063656973	107			And it's just standard selection: we can select for viability, chemical or fuel production, vaccine production, etc.
1063656973	108			This is a screen snapshot of some true design software that we're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer.

1063656973	111	number	=	You've seen recently, corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment.
1063656973	112			We have second- and third-generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar, to much higher-value fuels like octane or different types of butanol.
1063656973	113			But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock, and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road.
1063656973	114			And we think we'll have the first fourth-generation fuels in about 18 months.
1063656973	115			Sunlight and CO2 is one method ...
1063656973	116			but in our discovery around the world, we have all kinds of other methods.
1063656973	117			This is an organism we described in 1996.
1063656973	118			It lives in the deep ocean, about a mile and a half deep, almost at boiling-water temperatures.
1063656973	119			It takes CO2 to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source.

1063656973	128			Here's what the future may begin to look like with changing, now, the evolutionary tree, speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria, Archaea and, eventually, eukaryotes.
1063656973	129			We're a ways away from improving people: our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that.

2742797300	4			Blaise Agüera y Arcas: How PhotoSynth can connect the world's images
2742797300	5	number	you	What I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can, is some foundational work, some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago.
2742797300	6			This is Seadragon, and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data.
2742797300	7			We're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in, panning through it, rearranging it in any way we want.
2742797300	8			And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collections are or how big the images are.
2742797300	9	reference	them	Most of them are ordinary digital camera ones, but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel range.

2742797300	9	gender	this	Most of them are ordinary digital camera ones, but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel range.
2742797300	10			It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment.
2742797300	11	reference	it	It's also very flexible architecture.
2742797300	12			This is an entire book, so this is an example of non-image data.
2742797300	13			This is "Bleak House" by Dickens.
2742797300	15	number	you	To prove to you that it's really text, and not an image, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real representation of the text; it's not a picture.
2742797300	16			Maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-book.
2742797300	17	reference	it	I wouldn't recommend it.
2742797300	18			This is a more realistic case, an issue of The Guardian.
2742797300	19			Every large image is the beginning of a section.
2742797300	20			And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper, which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium.
2742797300	21			We've done something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian.
2742797300	22			We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution -- much higher than in an ordinary ad -- and we've embedded extra content.
2742797300	23	number	you	If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here.
2742797300	23	number	=	If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here.
2742797300	23	number	plural	If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here.
2742797300	24			Or other models, or even technical specifications.
2742797300	25			And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate.
2742797300	26			We hope that this means no more pop-ups and other rubbish like that -- shouldn't be necessary.
2742797300	27			Of course, mapping is one of those obvious applications for a technology like this.
2742797300	28			And this one I really won't spend any time on, except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well.
2742797300	29			But those are all the roads in the U.S. superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image.
2742797300	30	lexical	pull	So let's pull up, now, something else.

2742797300	32			This is a project called Photosynth, which marries two different technologies.

2742797300	35			And so this is live on the Web.
2742797300	36	reference	it=	It's powered by Seadragon.
2742797300	37	number	you	You can see that when we do these sorts of views, where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-resolution experience.

2742797300	38			But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful.
2742797300	39			The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots -- all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- all these shots were taken.
2742797300	40	number	you	So you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging, and these things have all been related spatially.
2742797300	40	number	=	So you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging, and these things have all been related spatially.
2742797300	41	number	you	I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments.
2742797300	42			Some are much more spatial.
2742797300	43	number	you	I would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data-sets -- this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer -- to show you what I think is really the punch line behind the Photosynth technology, It's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments we've put up on the website.
2742797300	44			We had to worry about the lawyers and so on.
2742797300	45			This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr.
2742797300	46			You just type Notre Dame into Flickr, and you get some pictures of guys in T-shirts, and of the campus and so on.
2742797300	47			And each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model.
2742797300	48			And so these are all Flickr images, and they've all been related spatially in this way.
2742797300	49			We can just navigate in this very simple way.
2742797300	50			You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft.
2742797300	51			It's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here.
2742797300	52	number	you	I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras: it's everything from cell-phone cameras to professional SLRs, quite a large number of them, stitched together in this environment.
2742797300	52	number	=	I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras: it's everything from cell-phone cameras to professional SLRs, quite a large number of them, stitched together in this environment.

2742797300	54			Somewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs -- here we go.
2742797300	55			This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly.
2742797300	56			We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment.
2742797300	57			What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment.
2742797300	58			This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory, visually, of what the Earth looks like -- and link all of that together.
2742797300	59			Those photos become linked, and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts.
2742797300	60			You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth.
2742797300	61			Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work.
2742797300	62			And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it, and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it.
2742797300	63			Their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered.
2742797300	64			If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are, then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data, and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space, into that meta-verse, using everybody else's photos, and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way.
2742797300	65			And of course, a by-product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth, collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on, but from the collective memory.
2742797300	66			Thank you so much.
2742797300	67			Chris Anderson: Do I understand this right?
2742797300	68			What your software is going to allow, is that at some point, really within the next few years, all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to link together?
2742797300	69			BAA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovering, creating hyperlinks, if you will, between images.
2742797300	70			It's doing that based on the content inside the images.
2742797300	71			And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information a lot of images have.
2742797300	72			Like when you do a web search for images, you type in phrases, and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of.
2742797300	73			What if that picture links to all of your pictures?
2742797300	74			The amount of semantic interconnection and richness that comes out of that is really huge.
2742797300	75			It's a classic network effect.
2742797300	76			CA: Truly incredible.
2742797300	77			Congratulations.

2598292742	3			Wade Davis: Dreams from endangered cultures
2598292742	4			You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways, who still feel their past in the wind, touch it in stones polished by rain, taste it in the bitter leaves of plants.
2598292742	5			Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way, or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning, or that in the Himalaya, the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma, is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology, and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense, but is just one model of reality, the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago.
2598292742	6			And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives.
2598292742	7			We're all born.
2598292742	8			We all bring our children into the world.
2598292742	9			We go through initiation rites.
2598292742	10			We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death, so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance, we all have art.
2598292742	11			But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song, the rhythm of the dance in every culture.
2598292742	12			And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo, or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti, or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya, the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes, or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara -- this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma, Everest, the goddess mother of the world.
2598292742	13			All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being, other ways of thinking, other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth.
2598292742	14			And this is an idea, if you think about it, can only fill you with hope.
2598292742	15	number	you	Now, together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet, and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere.

2598292742	20			No biologists, for example, would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true, and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity.
2598292742	21			And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss.
2598292742	22			When each of you in this room were born, there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet.

2598292742	25			It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world.
2598292742	26			Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind, a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
2598292742	27			And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey, fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children.
2598292742	28	reference	they	They're no longer being taught to babies, which means, effectively, unless something changes, they're already dead.

2598292742	29			What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence, to be the last of your people to speak your language, to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children?
2598292742	30			And yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks, because every two weeks, some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue.
2598292742	31			And I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be better, wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language?"
2598292742	32			And I say, "Great, let's make that language Yoruba.

2598292742	35			And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language.
2598292742	36	number	you	And so, what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere, a brief journey through the ethnosphere, to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost.

2598292742	37			Now, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say "different ways of being," I really do mean different ways of being.
2598292742	38			Take, for example, this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon, the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes.
2598292742	39			Now, this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend.
2598292742	40			They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called "linguistic exogamy:" you must marry someone who speaks a different language.
2598292742	41			And this is all rooted in the mythological past, yet the curious thing is in these long houses, where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage, you never hear anyone practicing a language.
2598292742	42			They simply listen and then begin to speak.
2598292742	43			Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with, the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador, an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958.
2598292742	44			In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake.
2598292742	45			They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures, forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives.

2598292742	52			Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind.
2598292742	53			In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti, infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength and Tonton Macoutes, and securing the poison used to make zombies.
2598292742	54			In order to make sense out of sensation, of course, I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun.
2598292742	55			And Voodoo is not a black magic cult.
2598292742	56			On the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview.
2598292742	57			It's interesting.
2598292742	58			If I asked you to name the great religions of the world, what would you say?
2598292742	59			Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever.
2598292742	60			There's always one continent left out, the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs.
2598292742	61	ellipsis	they	Well, of course, they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era.
2598292742	62			But, what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead.
2598292742	63			So, the living give birth to the spirits.
2598292742	64			The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water, responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living, so that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god.
2598292742	65			That's why the Voodooists like to say that "You white people go to church and speak about God.
2598292742	66			We dance in the temple and become God."
2598292742	67			And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be harmed?
2598292742	68			So you see these astonishing demonstrations: Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity, a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation.
2598292742	69			Now, of all the peoples that I've ever been with, the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia.

2598292742	74			And for this entire time, they are inculturated into the values of their society, values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance.
2598292742	75			And at the end of this amazing initiation, one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18, they see a sunrise.
2598292742	76			And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape, suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory.

2598292742	81			They call themselves the "elder brothers" and they say we, who are the younger brothers, are the ones responsible for destroying the world.
2598292742	82			Now, this level of intuition becomes very important.
2598292742	83			Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape, we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the "noble savage," which is an idea racist in its simplicity, or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are.
2598292742	84			Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia.
2598292742	85	ellipsis	either	There's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless, through time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it, but on a far subtler intuition: the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness.
2598292742	86			Now, what does that mean?
2598292742	87			It means that a young kid from the Andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined.
2598292742	88			Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant.
2598292742	89			What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world.
2598292742	90			I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut.
2598292742	91			That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world, spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation.

2598292742	93			Take this plant here.
2598292742	94			It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April.
2598292742	95			This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about, the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman's repertoire.
2598292742	96			What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation, but the elaboration of it.
2598292742	97	gender	it	It's made really of two different sources: on the one hand, this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines, harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis.
2598292742	98			This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines, very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine, 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine.
2598292742	99	number	you	If you've ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses, that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.
2598292742	99	number	=	If you've ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses, that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.
2598292742	100			To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity.
2598292742	102			In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s -- I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination.
2598292742	103			But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase.
2598292742	104	reference	they	They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO.

2598292742	105			Now, the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine.
2598292742	106			So you ask yourself a question.
2598292742	107			How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants, do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way, created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts?
2598292742	108			Well, we use that great euphemism, "trial and error," which is exposed to be meaningless.
2598292742	109			But you ask the Indians, and they say, "The plants talk to us."
2598292742	110			Well, what does that mean?
2598292742	111			This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca, all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest, all of which are referable to our eye as one species.
2598292742	112			And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say, "I thought you knew something about plants.
2598292742	113			I mean, don't you know anything?" And I said, "No."
2598292742	114			Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key.
2598292742	115			Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard, but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens.
2598292742	116			Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world, meaning our world, moves on.
2598292742	117			Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now, is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations, but rather as the era in which we stood by the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet.
2598292742	118			Now, the problem isn't change.
2598292742	119			All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life.
2598292742	120			And the problem is not technology itself.
2598292742	121			The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy.
2598292742	122			It's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere.
2598292742	124			Wherever you look around the world, you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to: whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan -- a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago.
2598292742	125	x	x	And now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers, where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea, where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or, in the case of the Yanomami, it's the disease entities that have come in, in the wake of the discovery of gold.
2598292742	126			Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research recently, you'll see it's a crude face of political domination.
2598292742	127			You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned, but ethnocide, the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned, it's universally, in many quarters, celebrated as part of a development strategy.
2598292742	128			And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level.
2598292742	129			I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about: 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes, 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution.
2598292742	130			This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama.
2598292742	131			That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion.
2598292742	132			His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal.
2598292742	133			His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy.
2598292742	134			He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn't bear to be without him.
2598292742	135			The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp.
2598292742	136			One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao, and for that transgression, she was given seven years of hard labor.
2598292742	137			The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear, but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold.
2598292742	138			And in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice: do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity?
2598292742	139			Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died, that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought, but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities.
2598292742	140			And it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps, been around for [150,000] years.
2598292742	141			The Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture, at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood; we created hierarchy specialization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago.
2598292742	142			The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old.
2598292742	143			Now, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia.
2598292742	144			When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human, they respond with 10,000 different voices.
2598292742	145			And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are: a fully conscious species, fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish.
2598292742	147			This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people, and this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather.
2598292742	148			The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people, and during the 1950s, to establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements.
2598292742	149			This old man's grandfather refused to go.
2598292742	150			The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons, all of his tools.

2598292742	153			So, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing.
2598292742	154			He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand.
2598292742	156			He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it.
2598292742	157			He skinned the dog and improvised a harness, took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled, harnessed up an adjacent dog, and disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt.
2598292742	158			Talk about getting by with nothing.
2598292742	160			The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together.
2598292742	161			It's our new homeland.
2598292742	162			It's called Nunavut.
2598292742	163			It's an independent territory.
2598292742	164			They control all mineral resources.
2598292742	165			An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people.
2598292742	166			And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet, to realize that they're not remote at all.

2598292742	169			And for all of us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children, become part of the naked geography of hope.
2598292742	170			So, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally, is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything.
2598292742	171			We think that polemics -- -- we think that polemics are not persuasive, but we think that storytelling can change the world, and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world.
2598292742	172			We get 35 million hits on our website every month.
2598292742	173			156 nations carry our television channel.
2598292742	174			Our magazines are read by millions.
2598292742	175			And what we're doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore, embrace gradually, one by one, the central revelation of anthropology: that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way, that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being.

3387304488	4			Barry Schwartz: The paradox of choice
3387304488	5	number	you	I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that I hope will resonate with other things you've already heard, and I'll try to make some connections myself, in case you missed them.
3387304488	6			But I want to start with what I call the "official dogma."
3387304488	7			The official dogma of what?
3387304488	8			The official dogma of all Western industrial societies.
3387304488	9			And the official dogma runs like this: if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens, the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom.
3387304488	10			The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good, valuable, worthwhile, essential to being human.
3387304488	11			And because if people have freedom, then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare, and no one has to decide on our behalf.
3387304488	12			The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice.
3387304488	13			The more choice people have, the more freedom they have, and the more freedom they have, the more welfare they have.
3387304488	14			This, I think, is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it.
3387304488	15			And it's also deeply embedded in our lives.
3387304488	16	number	you	I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us.
3387304488	17			This is my supermarket.
3387304488	18			Not such a big one.
3387304488	19			I want to say just a word about salad dressing.
3387304488	20			175 salad dressings in my supermarket, if you don't count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings, in the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you.
3387304488	21			So this is what the supermarket is like.
3387304488	22			And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system -- speakers, CD player, tape player, tuner, amplifier -- and in this one single consumer electronics store, there are that many stereo systems.
3387304488	23			We can construct six-and-a-half-million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store.
3387304488	24			You've got to admit that's a lot of choice.
3387304488	25			In other domains -- the world of communications.
3387304488	26			There was a time, when I was a boy, when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted, as long as it came from Ma Bell.
3387304488	27			You rented your phone.

3387304488	28	reference	it	You didn't buy it.
3387304488	29			One consequence of that, by the way, is that the phone never broke.
3387304488	30			And those days are gone.
3387304488	31			We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones, especially in the world of cell phones.
3387304488	32			These are cell phones of the future.
3387304488	33			My favorite is the middle one -- the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer, and crème brûlée torch.
3387304488	34			And if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet, you can rest assured that one day soon, you will.
3387304488	35			And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question.
3387304488	36			And do you know what the answer to this question now is?
3387304488	37			The answer is "no."
3387304488	38			It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much.
3387304488	39			So, in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things, the same explosion of choice is true.
3387304488	40			Health care.
3387304488	41			It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you what to do.
3387304488	42			Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you, "Well, we could do A, or we could do B.
3387304488	43			A has these benefits, and these risks.
3387304488	44			B has these benefits, and these risks.
3387304488	45			What do you want to do?"
3387304488	46			And you say, "Doc, what should I do?"
3387304488	47			And the doc says, "A has these benefits and risks, and B has these benefits and risks.
3387304488	48			What do you want to do?"
3387304488	49			And you say, "If you were me, Doc, what would you do?"
3387304488	50			And the doc says, "But I'm not you."
3387304488	51			And the result is -- we call it "patient autonomy," which makes it sound like a good thing, but it really is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something -- namely, the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions -- namely, the patient.

3387304488	54			The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed.
3387304488	55			Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice, as this slide is meant to indicate.
3387304488	56			We don't inherit an identity; we get to invent it.
3387304488	57			And we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like.
3387304488	58			And that means that every day, when you wake up in the morning, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.
3387304488	59			With respect to marriage and family, there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could, and then you started having kids as soon as you could.

3387304488	63	reference	they	And it's not because they're less smart, and it's not because they're less diligent.
3387304488	64	reference	they	It's because they are preoccupied, asking themselves, "Should I get married or not?
3387304488	65			Should I get married now?
3387304488	66			Should I get married later?
3387304488	67			Should I have kids first, or a career first?"
3387304488	68			All of these are consuming questions.
3387304488	69	reference	they	And they're going to answer these questions, whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses.
3387304488	70	reference	they	And indeed they should.
3387304488	71			These are important questions to answer.
3387304488	72			Work -- we are blessed, as Carl was pointing out, with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the Randolph Hotel.
3387304488	73			There is one corner, by the way, that I'm not going to tell anybody about, where the WiFi actually works.
3387304488	74	number	you	I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it.
3387304488	74	reference	=	I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it.
3387304488	74	gender	plural	I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it.
3387304488	75			So what this means, this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work, is that we have to make a decision, again and again and again, about whether we should or shouldn't be working.
3387304488	76			We can go to watch our kid play soccer, and we have our cell phone on one hip, and our Blackberry on our other hip, and our laptop, presumably, on our laps.
3387304488	77			And even if they're all shut off, every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game, we are also asking ourselves, "Should I answer this cell phone call?
3387304488	78			Should I respond to this email?
3387304488	79			Should I draft this letter?"
3387304488	80			And even if the answer to the question is "no," it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been.
3387304488	81			So everywhere we look, big things and small things, material things and lifestyle things, life is a matter of choice.
3387304488	82			And the world we used to live in looked like this.
3387304488	83			That is to say, there were some choices, but not everything was a matter of choice.
3387304488	84			And the world we now live in looks like this.
3387304488	85			And the question is, is this good news, or bad news?
3387304488	86			And the answer is, "yes."
3387304488	87			We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it.
3387304488	88			All of this choice has two effects, two negative effects on people.
3387304488	89			One effect, paradoxically, is that it produces paralysis, rather than liberation.
3387304488	90			With so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all.
3387304488	91	number	you	I'll give you one very dramatic example of this: a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans.
3387304488	92	gender	a	A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard, the gigantic mutual-fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces.
3387304488	92	gender	colleague=	A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard, the gigantic mutual-fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces.
3387304488	93			And what she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered, rate of participation went down two percent.
3387304488	94			You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five.
3387304488	96			Because with 50 funds to choose from, it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose, that you'll just put it off until tomorrow.
3387304488	97			And then tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and of course tomorrow never comes.
3387304488	98	lexical	passing	Understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away, it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer.
3387304488	98	ambiguity	up=	Understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away, it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer.
3387304488	99	reference	they	By not participating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employer, who would happily match their contribution.
3387304488	99	gender	=	By not participating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employer, who would happily match their contribution.

3387304488	99	ambiguity	people	By not participating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employer, who would happily match their contribution.
3387304488	100			So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.
3387304488	101			And I think it makes the world look like this.
3387304488	102	lexical	French	[And lastly, for all eternity, French, bleu cheese, or ranch?]
3387304488	102	ambiguity	=	[And lastly, for all eternity, French, bleu cheese, or ranch?]
3387304488	103			You really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity, right?
3387304488	104			You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund, or the wrong salad dressing.
3387304488	105			So that's one effect.
3387304488	106			The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice, we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from.
3387304488	107			And there are several reasons for this.
3387304488	108	reference	them	One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from, if you buy one, and it's not perfect -- and what salad dressing is?
3387304488	108	gender	=	One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from, if you buy one, and it's not perfect -- and what salad dressing is?
3387304488	109			-- it's easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better.
3387304488	110			And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made, and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made, even if it was a good decision.
3387304488	111			The more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose.
3387304488	112			Second, what economists call "opportunity costs."
3387304488	113			Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to.
3387304488	114			Well, when there are lots of alternatives to consider, it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen.
3387304488	115			Here's an example. [I can't stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W 85th street]
3387304488	116			Sorry if you're not New Yorkers.
3387304488	117	number	you	Here's what you're supposed to be thinking.
3387304488	117	number	=	Here's what you're supposed to be thinking.
3387304488	118			Here's this couple on the Hamptons.
3387304488	119			Very expensive real estate.
3387304488	120			Gorgeous beach.
3387304488	121			Beautiful day.
3387304488	122			They have it all to themselves.
3387304488	123			What could be better?
3387304488	124			Well, damn it, this guy is thinking, "It's August.
3387304488	126			I could be parking right in front of my building."
3387304488	127			And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity, day after day, to have a great parking space.
3387304488	128			Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose, even when what we choose is terrific.
3387304488	129			And the more options there are to consider, the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs.
3387304488	130			Here's another example.
3387304488	131	lexical	to	Now this cartoon makes a lot of points.
3387304488	131	ambiguity	make=	Now this cartoon makes a lot of points.
3387304488	132	reference	it=this	It makes points about living in the moment as well, and probably about doing things slowly.
3387304488	133			But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing, you're choosing not to do other things that may have lots of attractive features, and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive.
3387304488	134			Third: escalation of expectations.
3387304488	135	lexical	hit=	This hit me when I went to replace my jeans.
3387304488	135	ambiguity	wack	This hit me when I went to replace my jeans.
3387304488	136			I wear jeans almost all the time.
3387304488	137			There was a time when jeans came in one flavor, and you bought them, and they fit like crap, they were incredibly uncomfortable, if you wore them and washed them enough times, they started to feel OK.
3387304488	138			I went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones, and I said, "I want a pair of jeans.
3387304488	140	ellipsis	slim	And the shopkeeper said, "Do you want slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit?
3387304488	141	lexical	fly=	You want button fly or zipper fly?
3387304488	141	ambiguity	animal	You want button fly or zipper fly?

3387304488	143	reference	them	Do you want them distressed?
3387304488	143	lexical	=	Do you want them distressed?
3387304488	143	ambiguity	jeans	Do you want them distressed?
3387304488	144	ellipsis	boot	You want boot cut, tapered, blah blah."
3387304488	145			On and on he went.
3387304488	146			My jaw dropped.
3387304488	147			And after I recovered, I said, "I want the kind that used to be the only kind."
3387304488	148			He had no idea what that was, so I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans, and I walked out of the store -- truth! -- with the best-fitting jeans I had ever had.
3387304488	149	lexical	do	I did better.
3387304488	149	ambiguity	better	I did better.
3387304488	150	lexical	do	All this choice made it possible for me to do better.
3387304488	150	ambiguity	better	All this choice made it possible for me to do better.
3387304488	151			But -- I felt worse.
3387304488	152			Why? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself.
3387304488	153			The reason I felt worse is that, with all of these options available, my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up.
3387304488	154	reference	them	I had very low, no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor.
3387304488	154	lexical	=	I had very low, no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor.
3387304488	154	ambiguity	jeans	I had very low, no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor.
3387304488	155	reference	them	When they came in 100 flavors, damn it, one of them should've been perfect.
3387304488	155	lexical	=	When they came in 100 flavors, damn it, one of them should've been perfect.
3387304488	155	ambiguity	jeans	When they came in 100 flavors, damn it, one of them should've been perfect.
3387304488	156	reference	it	And what I got was good, but it wasn't perfect.
3387304488	157			And so I compared what I got to what I expected, and what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected.
3387304488	158			Adding options to people's lives can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be.
3387304488	159			And what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results, even when they're good results.
3387304488	160			Nobody in the world of marketing knows this.
3387304488	161			[It all looks so great.
3387304488	163	reference	they	Because if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about.
3387304488	163	lexical	=	Because if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about.
3387304488	163	ambiguity	nobody	Because if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about.
3387304488	164			The truth is more like this.
3387304488	165			[Everything was better back when everything was worse]
3387304488	166			The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse, it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise.
3387304488	167			Nowadays, the world we live in -- we affluent, industrialized citizens, with perfection the expectation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be.
3387304488	168			You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations, my expectations, have gone through the roof.
3387304488	169			The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations.
3387304488	170			I want to say -- just a little autobiographical moment -- that I actually am married to a wife, and she's really quite wonderful.
3387304488	171			I couldn't have done better.
3387304488	172	lexical	settle=	I didn't settle.
3387304488	172	ambiguity	solve	I didn't settle.
3387304488	173	lexical	settle=	But settling isn't always such a bad thing.
3387304488	173	ambiguity	establish	But settling isn't always such a bad thing.
3387304488	174			Finally -- One consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied, and you ask why, who's responsible, the answer is clear: the world is responsible.
3387304488	175			What could you do?
3387304488	176			When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available, and you buy one that is disappointing, and you ask why, who's responsible?
3387304488	177			It is equally clear that the answer to the question is "you."
3387304488	178	lexical	done=make	You could have done better.
3387304488	178	ambiguity	vs	You could have done better.
3387304488	179	x	x	With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display, there is no excuse for failure.
3387304488	180			And so when people make decisions, and even though the results of the decisions are good, they feel disappointed about them; they blame themselves.
3387304488	181			Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation.
3387304488	182			I believe a significant -- not the only, but a significant -- contributor to this explosion of depression, and also suicide, is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high, and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves, they think they're at fault.
3387304488	183			And so the net result is that we do better in general, objectively, and we feel worse.
3387304488	184	number	you	So let me remind you.
3387304488	185			This is the official dogma, the one that we all take to be true, and it's all false.
3387304488	186	reference	it	It is not true.
3387304488	187			There's no question that some choice is better than none, but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice.
3387304488	188			There's some magical amount.
3387304488	190			I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare.
3387304488	191			Now, as a policy matter -- I'm almost done -- as a policy matter, the thing to think about is this: what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence.
3387304488	192			There are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about several of them, where their problem is not that they have too much choice.
3387304488	193			Their problem is that they have too little.
3387304488	194			So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern, affluent, Western societies.
3387304488	195	number	you	And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this: Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult-to-install child seats don't help.
3387304488	196			It's a waste of money.
3387304488	197	number	you	What I'm telling you is that these expensive, complicated choices -- it's not simply that they don't help.
3387304488	198	reference	they	They actually hurt.
3387304488	198	gender	=	They actually hurt.
3387304488	199	reference	they	They actually make us worse off.
3387304488	199	gender	=	They actually make us worse off.
3387304488	200			If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options, not only would those people's lives be improved, but ours would be improved also, which is what economists call a "Pareto-improving move."
3387304488	201			Income redistribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this excess choice plagues us.
3387304488	202			So to conclude.
3387304488	203			[You can be anything you want to be -- no limits]
3387304488	204			You're supposed to read this cartoon, and, being a sophisticated person, say, "Ah! What does this fish know?
3387304488	205			You know, nothing is possible in this fishbowl."
3387304488	206			Impoverished imagination, a myopic view of the world -- and that's the way I read it at first.
3387304488	207			The more I thought about it, however, the more I came to the view that this fish knows something.
3387304488	208			Because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom.
3387304488	209			You have paralysis.
3387304488	210			If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible, you decrease satisfaction.
3387304488	211			You increase paralysis, and you decrease satisfaction.
3387304488	212			Everybody needs a fishbowl.
3387304488	213			This one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish, certainly for us.
3387304488	214			But the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery, and, I suspect, disaster.
3387304488	215			Thank you very much.

1966969117	14			sore or tender breasts.
1966969117	15			Symptoms can vary from month to month, although they tend to form a pattern over time.
1966969117	16			Between 2 and 4 in 100 women get PMS that is severe enough to prevent them from getting on with their daily lives.
1966969117	17			A very small number of women get an even more intense form of PMS known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which is not covered in this information.
1966969117	18			If you have questions about this, you should discuss it with your healthcare professional and see the Further information section below.
1966969117	19			What causes PMS?
1966969117	20			The exact cause of PMS is not known.
1966969117	21	reference	it	It could be linked to changes in the levels of your hormones and body chemicals.
1966969117	21	gender	=	It could be linked to changes in the levels of your hormones and body chemicals.
1966969117	22			The levels of your hormones change during your menstrual cycle.
1966969117	23			Some women are more sensitive to these hormonal changes, which can lead to the symptoms described.
1966969117	24			Women who use some forms of hormonal contraception are less affected by PMS.
1966969117	25			PMS has also been linked to a variety of chemical substances in your blood called neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
1966969117	26			How do I know I have PMS?
1966969117	27			If you are getting symptoms, you should write them down in a diary for at least two menstrual cycles in a row.
1966969117	28			Your healthcare professional will then review your diary with you to see whether your symptoms fit the pattern of PMS.
1966969117	29			If your symptom diary alone is not enough for diagnosis, you may be offered treatment with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues for a period of 3 months.
1966969117	30			This will temporarily stop your ovaries producing hormones, which may help with your diagnosis.
1966969117	31			What are my options?
1966969117	32	gender	help	There is a wide range of options to help you to manage your symptoms and allow you to get on with your daily life.
1966969117	33			Your healthcare professional will discuss these with you.
1966969117	34	gender	advised	Whatever option you choose, you will be advised to continue to keep a diary of your symptoms for at least another 2–3 months, as this can help to see whether a particular treatment is working.
1966969117	35			Lifestyle changes
1966969117	36			In the first instance, you can take some positive steps to try to improve your symptoms by:
1966969117	37			doing more exercise
1966969117	38			eating a healthy balanced diet –
1966969117	39			The NHS Choices website at www.nhs.uk/Livewell/healthy-eating/Pages/Healthyeating.aspx can provide more information about a healthy diet
1966969117	40			trying to reduce and manage stress, for example by using meditation, yoga and mindfulness.
1966969117	41			Speak with your healthcare professional if you would like further information about ways to change your lifestyle and about treatments that can help.
1966969117	42			Psychological support and therapy
1966969117	43			Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is known to help PMS symptoms and should be offered to you as a treatment option.
1966969117	44			This involves discussing your symptoms with a therapist.
1966969117	45	gender	help	It can help you learn new ways of managing some of your symptoms to reduce their impact on your daily life.
1966969117	46			Complementary therapy
1966969117	47			There are several alternative or complementary therapies for PMS.
1966969117	48			Many women find these helpful, although there is little evidence to show that they are effective.
1966969117	49			You should inform your healthcare professional if you are taking any medicine or supplement.
1966969117	50			This is because some complementary therapies may react with other medicines.
1966969117	51			Supplements of calcium, vitamin D, Vitex agnus-castus (a herb known as chasteberry) or Ginkgo biloba may be helpful.
1966969117	52			Evening primrose oil can reduce breast tenderness.
1966969117	53			Medical treatment
1966969117	54			Non-hormonal
1966969117	55			Two types of antidepressant medications have been shown to help PMS symptoms, namely selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).
1966969117	56			Antidepressants should only be prescribed by a healthcare professional.
1966969117	57			These can be taken on a daily basis for 2 weeks before your period or all the way through your cycle.
1966969117	58			Side effects may include nausea (feeling sick), insomnia (difficulty sleeping), tiredness and low libido (not being interested in having sex).
1966969117	59			SSRIs are recommended as one of the first-choice treatments for severe PMS.
1966969117	60			If you choose to stop taking antidepressants, it is important that you do so gradually so that you do not get withdrawal symptoms, such as headaches.
1966969117	61	gender	you	Your healthcare team will advise you.
1966969117	62			If you are planning a pregnancy or if you get pregnant, you should talk to your healthcare professional before stopping any medication.
1966969117	63			Water tablets (diuretics) such as spironolactone may help some women with some physical symptoms of PMS.
1966969117	64			Hormonal
1966969117	65			Combined oral contraceptive pill
1966969117	66			Some women find using the combined oral contraceptive pill helps with PMS symptoms.
1966969117	67			Newer types of contraceptive pills containing a progestogen called drospirenone have been shown to improve PMS symptoms.
1966969117	68			These are considered as first-choice treatments.
1966969117	69	gender	advised	You may be advised to take these pills continuously, without a break, for better symptom control.
1966969117	70			Estrogen hormone patches or gel
1966969117	71			Using estrogen hormone patches or gel can improve the physical and psychological symptoms of PMS.
1966969117	72			Unless you have had a hysterectomy (removal of your uterus), estrogen hormone patches or gel must be used in combination with a low dose of the hormone progestogen to prevent abnormal thickening of the lining of your womb.
1966969117	73	lexical	coil	Progestogens may be given in the form of tablets (taken for a minimum of 10 days each month), pessaries or a hormone-containing coil.
1966969117	73	ambiguity	=	Progestogens may be given in the form of tablets (taken for a minimum of 10 days each month), pessaries or a hormone-containing coil.
1966969117	74			Estrogen hormone patches or gel do not work as a contraceptive and so you will still need to use a method of birth control.
1966969117	75			Danazol
1966969117	76			Danazol (a synthetic hormone) in low doses can sometimes be used in the second half of your menstrual cycle to reduce breast tenderness.
1966969117	77			However, your healthcare professional should discuss with you the potential permanent side effects, such as deepening of your voice and enlargement of your clitoris.
1966969117	78			It is important to use contraception while using danazol because it can affect the development of a female baby in the uterus.
1966969117	79			Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues
1966969117	80			GnRH analogues may be recommended if you have severe PMS symptoms and when other treatments have not worked or are not suitable.
1966969117	81			These may also be used to help reach a diagnosis in some women, as mentioned in the How do I know I have PMS? section above.
1966969117	82			These medicines cause a temporary and reversible menopause, so you will not release eggs and you will not have any periods.
1966969117	83			If you use GnRH analogues for more than 6 months, it may affect your bone strength (osteoporosis).
1966969117	84			You will be advised to take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to protect your bones and reduce your menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes.
1966969117	85	gender	you	You will be advised to have regular bone density scans to check for osteoporosis if you use this treatment for more than 2 years.
1966969117	86			You should also make sure that you get regular exercise, have a balanced diet and do not smoke.
1966969117	87			Surgical treatment
1966969117	88			Your healthcare professional will only suggest surgical treatment if you have severe symptoms and all other treatments have not helped.
1966969117	89			Removal of your uterus along with both ovaries and fallopian tubes can help to improve severe PMS symptoms by making you menopausal.
1966969117	90			If you have surgical treatment for PMS, you may be advised to use HRT to prevent menopausal symptoms. If your uterus and ovaries have been removed, this will be estrogen-only HRT. If you still have your uterus, you will need both estrogen and progestogen. Progestogens protect the lining of your uterus, but may then re-introduce symptoms of PMS. See the RCOG patient information Treatment for symptoms of the menopause.
1966969117	91			If you are considering surgical treatment, your healthcare professional will advise you to use GnRH analogues and HRT for 3–6 months before surgery. GnRH analogues have a similar effect on your hormones as having your ovaries removed and will give you an idea of how you may feel after the operation. You may also be able to see whether you will benefit from surgery and whether HRT suits you.
1966969117	92			Surgical treatment such as endometrial ablation or hysterectomy without removal of both ovaries is not recommended for treatment of PMS.
1966969117	93			See the RCOG patient information Laparoscopic hysterectomy, Vaginal hysterectomy, Abdominal hysterectomy and Endometrial ablation.
1966969117	94			At what stage of treatment should I be referred to a gynaecologist?
1966969117	95	gender	you=feminine	If simple measures such as combined pills or SSRIs have not worked, your GP will refer you to a specialist.
1966969117	96			A team of healthcare professionals may be involved in your care, including your GP, a nurse specialist, a dietician, a mental health professional (psychiatrist, clinical psychologist or counsellor) and a gynaecologist.
1966969117	97			The make-up of the team will depend on the hospital you attend.
1949078195	1			Resumption of the session
1949078195	2	number	you	I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.

1949078195	4	number	=	You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.
1949078195	5			In the meantime, I should like to observe a minute' s silence, as a number of Members have requested, on behalf of all the victims concerned, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.
1949078195	6	number	rise	Please rise, then, for this minute' s silence.
1949078195	7			(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
1949078195	8			Madam President, on a point of order.
1949078195	9	gender	aware	You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka.
1949078195	10			One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam, who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago.
1949078195	11			Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?
1949078195	12			Yes, Mr Evans, I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.
1949078195	13			If the House agrees, I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested.
1949078195	14			Madam President, on a point of order.
1949078195	15			I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility.
1949078195	16			My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again.
1949078195	17			The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.
1949078195	18	reference	it	It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.
1949078195	19			I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.
1949078195	20			I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report, not a legislative proposal, and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday.
1949078195	21			That is precisely the time when you may, if you wish, raise this question, i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.
1949078195	22			Madam President, coinciding with this year' s first part-session of the European Parliament, a date has been set, unfortunately for next Thursday, in Texas in America, for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death.
1949078195	23			We shall call him Mr Hicks.
1949078195	24			At the request of a French Member, Mr Zimeray, a petition has already been presented, which many people signed, including myself.
1949078195	25			However, I would ask you, in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community, to make representations, using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent, to the President and to the Governor of Texas, Mr Bush, who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.
1949078195	26			This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.
1949078195	27	gender	thank	Thank you, Mr Segni, I shall do so gladly.
1949078195	28			Indeed, it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted.
1949078195	29			Madam President, I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest.
1949078195	30			It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.
1949078195	31			All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia, too, access to environmental information is a constitutional right.
1949078195	32			Now, however, he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.
1949078195	33	lexical	resolution=	We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.
1949078195	33	ambiguity	finding/observaton	We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.
1949078195	34	gender	you=feminine	These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament's position, as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted, clear as far as Russia is concerned.
1949078195	35	gender	pleased	Yes, Mrs Schroedter, I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter.
1949078195	36			Madam President, I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that, during this first part-session of the new year, the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.
1949078195	37			But, Madam President, my personal request has not been met.
1949078195	38			Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one, there is still no Dutch channel, which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.
1949078195	39	gender	you=feminine	I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.
1949078195	40			Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors' meeting on Wednesday.
1949078195	41	reference	it	It will, I hope, be examined in a positive light.
1949078195	41	lexical	=	It will, I hope, be examined in a positive light.
1949078195	41	ambiguity	this	It will, I hope, be examined in a positive light.
1949078195	42			Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes?
1949078195	43			Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected?
1949078195	44			Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998?
1949078195	45			Why has there been no fire drill, either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings?
1949078195	46			Why are there no fire instructions?
1949078195	47			Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?
1949078195	48			Why are no-smoking areas not enforced?
1949078195	49			It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.
1949078195	50			Mrs Lynne, you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done.
1949078195	51	gender	certain	I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors, and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.
1949078195	52			Madam President, Mrs Díez González and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, which appeared in a Spanish newspaper.
1949078195	53	reference	they	The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session.

1949078195	54	gender	=	I would ask that they reconsider, since this is not the case.
1949078195	55			The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio' s intervention, on another occasion, and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.
1949078195	56			Mr Berenguer Fuster, we shall check all this.
1949078195	57			I admit that, at present, the issue seems to be somewhat confused.
1949078195	58	reference	it	We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.
1949078195	58	gender	=	We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.
1949078195	59			Madam President, I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past?
1949078195	60			Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.
1949078195	61			So Parliament should send a message, since that is the wish of the vast majority.
1949078195	62			It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.
1949078195	63			As people have said, the situation there is extremely volatile.
1949078195	64			There is, in fact, a risk of a military coup in the future.
1949078195	65			We do not know what is happening.
1949078195	66			So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people?
1949078195	67			In any event, this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday.
1949078195	68			Agenda
1949078195	69			The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.
1949078195	70			No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday.
1949078195	71			Relating to Wednesday:
1949078195	72			The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission.
1949078195	73			I would like Mr Barón Crespo, who made the request, to speak to propose it.
1949078195	74			That is, if he so wishes, of course.
1949078195	75			Then we shall follow the usual procedure, hearing one speaker in favour and one against.
1949078195	76			Madam President, the presentation of the Prodi Commission' s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech.
1949078195	77			This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and, therefore, basically dictates this Parliament' s political and legislative activity for the next five years.
1949078195	78			I would also like to point out, Madam President, that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature.
1949078195	79	reference	it	It did so again during this legislature, in July, and then, in September, it voted once more to approve the whole Commission.
1949078195	79	ellipsis	=	It did so again during this legislature, in July, and then, in September, it voted once more to approve the whole Commission.
1949078195	79	reference	the	It did so again during this legislature, in July, and then, in September, it voted once more to approve the whole Commission.
1949078195	80			There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.
1949078195	81			To this end, I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.
1949078195	82			The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents, that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma.
1949078195	83			Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme, in which case it should clarify it.
1949078195	84	gender	ist	According to its President, it is in a position to do so.
1949078195	84	reference	president	According to its President, it is in a position to do so.
1949078195	85			Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio, I believe that, before voting, it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme, as agreed.
1949078195	86			Alternatively, Parliament is not ready to examine this programme, as some appear to be suggesting.
1949078195	87			In my opinion, this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware, in writing, of a speech concerning the Commission' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier, as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so we could forego the debate, since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it.
1949078195	88			My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen, debate and reflect, there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that, if the Commission is ready to do so, we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.
1949078195	89			Therefore, the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and which you have mentioned, is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday, including its proposed administrative reform, because, otherwise, we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: on the pretext that there is no text, on the one hand, the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.
1949078195	90			Therefore, Madam President, I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.
1949078195	91			(Applause from the PSE Group)
1949078195	92			Madam President, I really am quite astonished at Mr Barón Crespo' s behaviour and the fact that he is now asking for this item to be put on Wednesday's agenda.
1949078195	93			Mr Barón Crespo, you were unable to attend the Conference of Presidents last Thursday.
1949078195	94			I am not criticising this; it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them.
1949078195	95			Mr Hänsch represented you on this occasion.
1949078195	96			In the Conference of Presidents, we had an in-depth discussion.
1949078195	97			Your Group was alone in advocating what you are saying now.
1949078195	98	reference	it	We then put it to a vote.
1949078195	99			As you know, each chairman has the same number of votes as his Group has Members.
1949078195	100			There was a vote on this matter.
1949078195	101			As I recall, the outcome of this vote was 422 votes to 180 with a few abstentions.
1949078195	102			This means that all the Groups with the exception of the non-attached Members - but, of course, they are not a Group - were in agreement; only your Group thought that we should proceed as you have proposed here.
1949078195	103			All of the others were of a different opinion.
1949078195	104			That was the decision.
1949078195	105			I should now like to comment on the issue itself.
1949078195	106			We have confidence in the Commission and in Romano Prodi and, after a difficult procedure, as everyone knows, the vast majority of our Group supported the vote of confidence in Romano Prodi and the Commission.
1949078195	107			We believe, however, that the Commission's strategic plan needs to be debated within a proper procedural framework, not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the European Parliament, but also on the basis of a document which is adopted in the Commission and which describes this programme over the five-year period.
1949078195	108			There is no such document!
1949078195	109			The Commission will present its programme for the year 2000 in February.
1949078195	110	reference	it	We have said, very well, if the Commission does not wish to introduce the 2000 programme as early as January then we will do it in February.
1949078195	111			We have agreed to this.
1949078195	112			After all, we do not wish to quarrel with the Commission; if at all possible, we believe that the Commission and Parliament need to tread the same path.
1949078195	113			However, we in Parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the Commission and we do not have to agree with everything which comes out of the Commission.
1949078195	114			I should like us to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the five-year programme in our Groups.
1949078195	115			You cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this House and have no idea of its content.
1949078195	116			That is why we would recommend - and it is my impression that the Commission is also open to this idea - that we hold the debate on the Commission's long-term programme up to the year 2005 in February - and I hope that the Commission will agree on a programme before then which it will propose to us - and that, at the same time, in February we also hold the debate on the Commission's legislative programme for the year 2000.
1949078195	117	lexical	subjects	The fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together.
1949078195	117	ambiguity	=	The fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together.
1949078195	118			That is why my Group firmly rejects the proposal made by the Socialist Group.
1949078195	119			(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
1949078195	120			Madam President, I would like to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, amongst those, the decision establishing its agenda.
1949078195	121			We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide.
1949078195	122			But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate, as Mr Barón Crespo has reminded us, which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission' s legislative programme, on the broad areas of action for the next five years, that is to say, for this legislature.
1949078195	123			Madam President, I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission' s legislative programme.
1949078195	124			I would also like to say that the Commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally, on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.
1949078195	125			Therefore, Madam President, I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and, when Parliament decides, - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for 2000, which is what we fully agreed upon.
1949078195	126			I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.
1949078195	127			(Parliament rejected the request)
1949078195	128	gender	president	President.
1949078195	129			Still on the subject of Wednesday' s sitting, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.
1949078195	130			The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.
1949078195	131			Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this?
1949078195	132			Madam President, I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists.
1949078195	133			I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter.
1949078195	134			I do not know whether this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would, in any case, be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already.
1949078195	135			Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.
1949078195	136			That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.
1949078195	137	gender	thank	Thank you, Mr Poettering.
1949078195	138			We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request.
1949078195	139			Madam President, I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering' s lack of logic.
1949078195	140			He has just been preaching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents, and now he is doing just the same.
1949078195	141			We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups.
1949078195	142			As my fellow chairmen will recall, I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax, but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it.
1949078195	143			It is not a lot to ask.
1949078195	144			I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion, particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.
1949078195	145			We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda.
1949078195	146			(Parliament rejected the request, with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions)
1949078195	147			Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate.
1949078195	148			Thank you very much.
1949078195	149			Madam President, has my vote been counted?
1949078195	150			I was unable to vote electronically, since I do not have a card.
1949078195	151			My vote was "in favour" .
1949078195	152			Indeed, if we add the two Members who have declared themselves, then the result of the vote would be ....
1949078195	153			Madam President, the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote.
1949078195	154			There is no room for amendments.
1949078195	155			Ladies and gentlemen, once again, we see it is essential for Members to bring their voting cards along on a Monday.
1949078195	156			Clearly there is a problem here.
1949078195	157			That being the case, I shall have to make a decision.
1949078195	158			I too forgot my card, and I would have voted against.
1949078195	159			I therefore consider that the oral question may be kept on the agenda as per the vote.
1949078195	160			This is the last time that we shall make allowances for Members who have forgotten their cards.
1949078195	161			Let that be clearly noted and understood.
1949078195	162			(Applause)
1949078195	163			The oral question will therefore remain on the agenda, and yes, your President is entitled to vote just as she is entitled to forget her voting card.
1949078195	164			We shall continue with the other amendments to the agenda.
1949078195	165			Madam President, in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group.
1949078195	166			That did not happen.
1949078195	167			I would appreciate it if, on the close of this item of business, I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group.
1949078195	168			This is an important matter.
1949078195	169			It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.
1949078195	170			Madam President, I do not wish to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor, to comment on Mr Barón Crespo's motion.
1949078195	171			You did not call me either.
1949078195	172			I regret this, but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.
1949078195	173	gender	sorry	I am terribly sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox.
1949078195	174			I did not see you asking to speak.
1949078195	175			Even so, I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes.
1949078195	176			When we adopt the Minutes for today' s sitting tomorrow, then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.
1949078195	177			This seems to me to be a workable solution.
1949078195	178			Of course, the Minutes for tomorrow' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.
1949078195	179			I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes.
1949078195	180			Mr Cox, Mr Hänsch, would this be acceptable to you?
1949078195	181			Madam President, if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not, and cannot, object to that.
1949078195	182			If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote, I accept that but with reservations.
1949078195	183			We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes, as we always do, of course.
1949078195	184			If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted, then we may correct them, if necessary.
1949078195	185			(The order of business was adopted thus amended)
1949078195	186			Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods
1949078195	187			The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)).
1949078195	188			Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.
1949078195	189			Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.
1949078195	190			Secondly, by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.
1949078195	191			Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.
1949078195	192			All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.
1949078195	193			Our amendments from the first reading have, I believe, been taken into account very satisfactorily.
1949078195	194	reference	they	They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.

1949078195	195			The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive, is something which I would urge you to support.
1949078195	196			By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.
1949078195	197			I would urge you to endorse this.
1949078195	198			Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.
1949078195	199			As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as, I believe, we all do, of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.
1949078195	200			The renovation project, which lasted for months, cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe.
1949078195	201			The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit.
1949078195	202			In fact, all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.
1949078195	203			Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time.
1949078195	204			All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety.
1949078195	205			We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.
1949078195	206			Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.
1949078195	207			I should like to address one final point.
1949078195	208			We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done.
1949078195	209			In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.
1949078195	210			Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has, at its heart, the issue of transport safety.
1949078195	211			The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway.
1949078195	212			I congratulate him on his excellent report.
1949078195	213			Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London, the terrible rail crash in Norway, the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.
1949078195	214			The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been retained.
1949078195	215			My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.
1949078195	216			When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.
1949078195	217			We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.
1949078195	218			Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.
1949078195	219			I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.
1949078195	220			We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements.
1949078195	221			This is a pity, in a sense.
1949078195	222			Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.
1949078195	223			This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.
1949078195	224			Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead. Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.
1949078195	225			Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.
1949078195	226			In short, the issue is an important one.
1949078195	227			If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.
1949078195	228			There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors.
1949078195	229			These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which causes problems.
1949078195	230			It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.
1949078195	231			The work is done.
1949078195	232			All that remains is the business of enforcement.
1949078195	233			I would like to mention one final point.
1949078195	234			With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months' time.
1949078195	235			This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.
1949078195	236			This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.
1949078195	237			Madam President, the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so.
1949078195	238			The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.
1949078195	239			Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.
1949078195	240			The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.
1949078195	241			I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations, although I would have preferred it if uniform, set standards and modules had been established, so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.
1949078195	242			This, however, does not seem feasible.
1949078195	243			Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can, therefore, give it my wholehearted support.
1949078195	244			Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which, though technical, are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.
1949078195	245			I should like to make just a few comments.
1949078195	246			Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea.
1949078195	247			Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long.
1949078195	248			This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.
1949078195	249			My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns the minimum standards.
1949078195	250			In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.
1949078195	251			However, when it comes to safety, I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden, for example, is in principle no different from safety in Germany, Italy or Austria.
1949078195	252			I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.
1949078195	253			Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.
1949078195	254			My third point has also been mentioned already.
1949078195	255			As you know, like Mr Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a particularly important role.
1949078195	256			We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.
1949078195	257			But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.
1949078195	258			Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.
1949078195	259			We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.
1949078195	260			The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.
1949078195	261			Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport.
1949078195	262			As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.
1949078195	263			The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.
1949078195	264			In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.
1949078195	265			In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.
1949078195	266			Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster.
1949078195	267			Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.
1949078195	268			Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.
1949078195	269			This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.
1949078195	270			But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.
1949078195	271			As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.
1949078195	272			I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.
1949078195	273			The debate is closed.
1949078195	274			The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.

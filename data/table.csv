"<seg id=""187"">","The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)).",X,X,,
"<seg id=""188"">","Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""189"">","Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""190"">","Secondly, by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""191"">","Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""192"">",All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""193"">","Our amendments from the first reading have, I believe, been taken into account very satisfactorily.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""194"">","They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.","reference

"<seg id=""195"">","The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive, is something which I would urge you to support.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""196"">","By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""197"">",I would urge you to endorse this.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""198"">","Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""199"">","As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as, I believe, we all do, of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""200"">","The renovation project, which lasted for months, cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""201"">",The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""202"">","In fact, all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""203"">","Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""204"">","All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""205"">",We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""206"">",Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""207"">",I should like to address one final point.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""208"">","We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""209"">","In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""210"">","Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has, at its heart, the issue of transport safety.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""211"">","The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""212"">",I congratulate him on his excellent report.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""213"">","Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London, the terrible rail crash in Norway, the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""214"">",The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been retained.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""215"">",My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""216"">",When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""217"">",We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""218"">","Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""219"">","I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""220"">","We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""221"">","This is a pity, in a sense.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""222"">","Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""223"">","This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""224"">","Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead. Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""225"">","Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""226"">","In short, the issue is an important one.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""227"">","If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""228"">","There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""229"">","These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which causes problems.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""230"">",It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""231"">",The work is done.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""232"">",All that remains is the business of enforcement.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""233"">",I would like to mention one final point.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""234"">","With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months' time.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""235"">",This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""236"">","This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""237"">","Madam President, the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""238"">","The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""239"">",Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""240"">","The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""241"">","I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations, although I would have preferred it if uniform, set standards and modules had been established, so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""242"">","This, however, does not seem feasible.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""243"">","Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can, therefore, give it my wholehearted support.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""244"">","Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which, though technical, are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.",X,X,,from here the vice-president changes to mr gerhard schmid
"<seg id=""245"">",I should like to make just a few comments.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""246"">","Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""247"">","Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""248"">","This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""249"">",My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns the minimum standards.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""250"">","In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""251"">","However, when it comes to safety, I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden, for example, is in principle no different from safety in Germany, Italy or Austria.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""252"">","I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""253"">",Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""254"">",My third point has also been mentioned already.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""255"">","As you know, like Mr Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a particularly important role.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""256"">",We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""257"">","But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""258"">","Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""259"">","We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""260"">","The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""261"">","Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""262"">","As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""263"">",The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""264"">","In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""265"">","In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""266"">","Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""267"">","Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""268"">","Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""269"">","This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""270"">",But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""271"">","As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""272"">","I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.",X,X,,
"<seg id=""273"">",The debate is closed.,X,X,,
"<seg id=""274"">",The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.,X,X,,
